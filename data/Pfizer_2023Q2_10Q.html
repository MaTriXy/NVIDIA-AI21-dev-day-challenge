<p>We prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2022 Form 10-K. As permitted under the SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted.</p>
<p>These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2022 Form 10-K<em>.</em> Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.</p>

<p>U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022.</p>
<p>We manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See <em><a href="#note-13.-segment-geographic-and-other-revenue-information"><u>Note 13A</u></a></em> below and <em>Note 17A</em> in our 2022 Form 10-K<em>.</em></p>
<p>Business development activities impacted financial results in the periods presented. In March 2023, we and Seagen announced that the companies entered into an agreement under which we will acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines, for $229 in cash per Seagen share for a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. We expect to finance the transaction substantially through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023 (see <a href="#_bookmark15"><em><u>Note 7D</u></em></a>), and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The transaction was approved by Seagen’s shareholders in May 2023. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. See <em><a href="#note-2.-acquisitions-discontinued-operations-equity-method-investment-and-research-and-development-arrangement"><u>Note 2</u></a></em> below, as well as <em>Notes 1A</em> and <em>2</em> in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>We have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation for segment reporting.</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">
<li><p><em><u>New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>On January 1, 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard for supplier finance programs which requires increased disclosures in the notes to our financial statements. See <em><a href="#note-8.-other-financial-information"><u>Note 8C</u></a>.</em></p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2023, we adopted new accounting standards on reference rate reform that provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that were discontinued after June 30, 2023. We applied certain of the optional expedients related to hedge accounting relationships. The main purpose of the expedients is to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted and make it easier to apply the requirements to maintain hedge accounting during the transition period through December 31, 2024.</p>

<p><em>Trade Accounts Receivable––</em>Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.</p>
<p>In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.</p>
<p>During the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable, see <em>Note 1G</em> in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<p><em>GBT––</em>On October 5, 2022, we acquired GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $5.7 billion ($5.2 billion, net of cash acquired). In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $4.4 billion in <em>Identifiable intangible assets</em>, consisting of $3.0 billion of IPR&amp;D and $1.4 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of six years, (ii) $1.1 billion of <em>Goodwill,</em> (iii) $672 million of inventories to be sold over approximately three years, (iv) $568 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (v) $331 million of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p><em>Biohaven––</em>On October 3, 2022, we acquired Biohaven, the maker of Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy approved for both acute treatment of migraine and prevention of episodic migraine in adults. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.8 billion, which includes the fair value of Pfizer’s previous investment in Biohaven on the acquisition date of approximately $300 million. In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $12.1 billion in <em>Identifiable intangible assets</em>, consisting of $11.6 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of 11 years and $450 million of IPR&amp;D, (ii) $813 million of inventories to be sold over approximately two years, (iii) $795 million of <em>Goodwill</em>, (iv) $398 million of trade accounts receivable, (v) $1.4 billion of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022, (vi) $566 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (vii) $476 million of <em>Other current liabilities</em>. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p><em>Arena––</em>On March 11, 2022, we acquired Arena, a clinical stage company with development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology and cardiology. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $6.6 billion ($6.2 billion, net of cash acquired). The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in the first quarter of 2023. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i) $5.5 billion in <em>Identifiable intangible assets</em>, consisting of $5.0 billion of IPR&amp;D and $460 million of indefinite-lived licensing agreements and other, (ii) $1.0 billion of <em>Goodwill</em> and (iii) $490 million of net deferred tax liabilities.</p>

<p><em>Haleon</em>/<em>Consumer Healthcare JV––</em>On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint historical</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><span id="_bookmark10" class="anchor"></span>consumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary shares of Haleon after the demerger.</p>
<p>The carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022 is $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, and is reported in <em>Equity-method investments</em>. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion. Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into</p>
<p>U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to $271 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see <a href="#note-6.-accumulated-other-comprehensive-loss-excluding-noncontrolling-interests"><em><u>Note 6</u></em></a>) and our share of Haleon’s earnings of $219 million, partially offset by $88 million in dividends received. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in <em>Other (income)/deductions––net</em>. Our total share of Haleon’s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2023, was $151 million. Our total share of Haleon’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2023, was $219 million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2022, was $150 million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2022, was $335 million. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is included in <em>Other (income)/deductions—net</em> and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented. See <em><a href="#note-4.-other-incomedeductionsnet"><u>Note 4</u></a>.</em></p>
<p>Summarized financial information for our equity-method investee, Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV, for the three and six months ending March 31, 2023, the most recent period available, and for the three and six months ending March 31, 2022, is as follows:</p>

<li><p><em><u>Research and Development Arrangement</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Research and Development Funding Arrangement with Blackstone––</em>In April 2023, we entered into an arrangement with Blackstone under which we will receive up to a total of $550 million in 2023 through 2026 to co-fund our quarterly development costs for specified treatments. As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of <em>Research and development expenses</em> using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to <em>Research and development expenses</em> for the second quarter of 2023 was $45 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to <em>Amortization of intangible assets</em> over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to <em>Amortization of intangible assets</em> over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as <em>Cost of sales</em> when incurred.</p>

<li><p><em><u>Tran</u>sf <u>orming to a More Focused Company</u> <u>Program</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2019, we announced that we would be incurring costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company Program, a multi-year effort to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our operating structure following Pfizer’s transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based global biopharmaceutical business. This program includes activities to (i) restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our operating structure;</p>
<p>(ii) transform our commercial go-to-market model; and (iii) optimize our manufacturing network and R&amp;D operations.</p>
<p>The activities associated with transforming our commercial go-to-market model are substantially complete. Activities associated with restructuring our corporate enabling functions and optimizing our manufacturing network and R&amp;D operations are ongoing and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023. The costs to restructure our corporate enabling functions, and to optimize our R&amp;D operations and reduce cycle times, as well as to further prioritize our internal R&amp;D portfolio, primarily include severance and implementation costs. The costs to optimize our manufacturing network largely include severance, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, and accelerated depreciation.</p>
<p>From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through July 2, 2023, we incurred costs of $3.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion ($1.1 billion of restructuring charges) is associated with Biopharma. We have incurred approximately 85% of total expected costs to date, and we expect the remaining costs to be substantially incurred through 2023.</p>

Restructuring charges/(credits) associated with Biopharma: charges of $4 million and credits of $23 million for the three and six months ended July 2, 2023, respectively, and charges of $50 million and $46 million for the three and six months ended July 3, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>(b) Represents external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services.</p>
<p>(c) Represents external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, such as expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, and certain other qualifying costs. In the six months ended July 2, 2023, integration costs and other were mostly related to our acquisitions of GBT and Biohaven. In the six months ended July 3, 2022, integration costs and other were mostly related to our acquisition of Arena, including $138 million in payments to Arena employees in the first quarter of 2022 for the fair value of previously unvested long- term incentive awards that was recognized as post-closing compensation expense.</p>
<p>(d) Represents the impact of changes in the estimated useful lives of assets involved in restructuring actions.</p>
<p>(e) Represents external, incremental costs directly related to implementing our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.</p>

<p><sup>(a)</sup> The decrease in net interest expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 reflects higher interest expense driven by our $31 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued in May 2023 as part of the financing for our proposed acquisition of Seagen, which was more than offset by higher interest income on the investment of the net proceeds from the debt issuance.</p>
<p><sup>(b)</sup> The net gains in the second quarter of 2023 include, among other things, unrealized gains of $202 million related to our investment in Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel). The net losses in the first six months of 2023 include, among other things, unrealized losses of $276 million related to our investment in BioNTech. The net losses in 2022 included, among other things, unrealized losses of $432 million in the second quarter and $776 million in the first six months related to our investments in BioNTech and Cerevel.</p>
<p>(c) The second quarter and first six months of 2023 primarily include certain product liability and other legal expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The second quarter and first six months of 2022 primarily included certain product liability expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The first six months of 2022 also included legal obligations related to pre-acquisition commitments.</p>
<p><sup>(d)</sup> The first six months of 2023 primarily represents intangible asset impairment charges, including $128 million associated with Other business activities, related to IPR&amp;D and developed technology rights for acquired software assets and reflects unfavorable pivotal trial results and updated commercial forecasts, and $120 million associated with our Biopharma segment resulting from the discontinuation of a study related to an out-licensed IPR&amp;D asset for the treatment of prostate cancer, acquired in our Array BioPharma Inc. acquisition.</p>

<p><sup>(a)</sup> The fair value amount is presented as of the date of impairment, as this asset is not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. See also <em>Note 1E</em> in our 2022 Form 10-K<em>.</em></p>
<p><sup>(b)</sup> Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2023. Fair value was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. We started with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.</p>
<h3 id="note-5.-tax-matters">Note 5. Tax Matters</h3>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><em><u>Taxes on Income</u> f <u>rom Continuing Operations</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was (3.1)% for the second quarter of 2023, compared to 13.7% for the second quarter of 2022, and was 7.5% for the first six months of 2023, compared to 13.4% for the first six months of 2022. The negative effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 and the lower effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2022, were primarily due to tax benefits in the second quarter of 2023 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years and a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.</p>
<p>We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The fifth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2023 due date. The sixth annual installment is due April 15, 2024 and is reported in current <em>Income taxes payable</em> as of July 2, 2023. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent <em>Other taxes payable.</em> Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">
<li><p><em><u>Tax Contingencies</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.</p>
<p>The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years 2019-2023 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.</p>

<p><em>Foreign Exchange Risk––</em>A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.</p>
<p>The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar and Canadian dollar, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.</p>
<p><em>Interest Rate Risk––</em>Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.</p>

<p>As of July 2, 2023, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio consist primarily of money market funds mainly invested in U.S. Treasury and government debt, as well as sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Germany, Canada, Japan, and France.</p>
<p>With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of July 2, 2023, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $854 million, for which we have posted collateral of $867 million with a corresponding amount reported in <em>Short-term investments</em>. As of July 2, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $422 million, for which we have received collateral of $366 million with a corresponding amount reported in <em>Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.</em></p>

<p>We maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating financial institutions.

Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate and we pay the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the original maturity dates, which is generally within 90 to 120 days of the invoice date. The agreements with the financial institutions do not require Pfizer to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance program. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within trade payables in our consolidated balance sheet. As of July 2, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, $779 million and $849 million of our trade payables to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding.</p>

<h3 id="note-12.-contingencies-and-certain-commitments">Note 12. Contingencies and Certain Commitments</h3>
<p>We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see <em><a href="#note-5.-tax-matters"><u>Note 5B</u></a>.</em></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><em><u>Legal Proceedin</u>gs</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion- related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.</p>
<p>We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.</p>
<p>Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.</p>
<p>The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.</p>
<p><em><u>A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Lit</u>ig<u>ation</u></em></p>
<p>We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-</p>
<p>U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In November 2022, BMS received permission to appeal the High Court’s decision and the appeal hearing was held in April 2023. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.</p>
<p>We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. For example, we have challenged certain of GSK’s RSV vaccine patents in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner’s patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor’s vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.</p>
<p>We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.</p>
<h3 id="actions-in-which-we-are-the-plaintiff-xeljanz-tofacitinib">Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff Xeljanz (tofacitinib)</h3>
<p>Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.</p>

<p><em><u>A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Lit</u>ig<u>ation</u></em></p>
<p>We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.</p>
<h3 id="asbestos">Asbestos</h3>
<p>Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.</p>
<p>Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.</p>
<p>There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.</p>
<h3 id="effexor">Effexor</h3>
<p>Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.</p>
<h3 id="lipitor">Lipitor</h3>
<p>Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and</p>
<p>(ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the</p>
<p>U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.</p>
<p>Also, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.</p>
<h3 id="epipen-direct-purchaser">EpiPen (Direct Purchaser)</h3>
<p>In February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, the District Court granted Pfizer’s motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</p>
<h3 id="nexium-24hr-and-protonix">Nexium 24HR and Protonix</h3>
<p>A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the federal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. As part of the combination of our and GSK’s consumer healthcare businesses to form Haleon, Haleon assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR. In June 2023, the parties reached an agreement to resolve the litigation related to Protonix on terms not material to Pfizer.</p>

<h3 id="zantac">Zantac</h3>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson &amp; Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson &amp; Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, asserting a consolidated consumer class action alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants’ Daubert motions to exclude plaintiffs’ expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, and dismissed the litigation.</p>
<p>In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants’ sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts.</p>
<h3 id="chantix">Chantix</h3>
<p>Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer’s voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.</p>

<p>In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls.

<li><p><em><u>Guarantees and Indemn</u>if <u>ications</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of July 2, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.</p>
<p>In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters. Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.</p>
<p>See <em><a href="#_bookmark15"><u>Note 7D</u></a></em> for information on Pfizer Inc.’s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.</p>
<p>We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.</p>

<h3 id="note-13.-segment-geographic-and-other-revenue-information">Note 13. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information</h3>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><em><u>Segment Information</u></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation, an operating segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that includes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&amp;D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer’s R&amp;D focus areas<em>.</em> Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&amp;D services from WRDM and GPD. These services include IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.</p>
<p><em>Other Business Activities and Reconciling Items––</em>Other business activities include the operating results of Business Innovation as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with: (i) R&amp;D and medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization and costs associated with our GPD organization; (ii) corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs; (iii) overhead costs primarily associated with our manufacturing operations; and (iv) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV. Reconciling items include the following items, transactions and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><em>Segment Assets––</em>We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $220 billion as of July 2, 2023 and $197 billion as of December 31, 2022.</p>

<p>In May 2023, we and our collaboration partner, BioNTech, amended our contract with the EC to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to the EU. The amended agreement includes rephasing of delivery of doses annually through 2026 and an aggregate volume reduction, providing additional flexibility for EU member states. The EC will maintain access to future adapted COVID-19 vaccines and the ability to donate doses, in alignment with the original agreement.

<p><sup>(a)</sup> See <em>Note 1A</em> in our 2022 Form 10-K for information about our recent organizational changes within Biopharma. See <em>Note 13A</em> above for information about Business Innovation. Prior-period financial information has been revised to reflect the current period presentation.</p>
<p><sup>(b)</sup> Excludes revenues for certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech, which are included in the PC1 contract development and manufacturing organization. See footnote (e) below.</p>
<p><sup>(c)</sup> Immunoglobulin (Ig) portfolio includes the revenues from Panzyga, Octagam and Cutaquig.</p>
<p>(d) Erbitux® is a registered trademark of ImClone LLC.</p>
<p>(e) PC1 includes revenues from our contract manufacturing, including certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech ($6 million and $10 million for the second quarter and the first six months of 2023, respectively, and $55 million and $101 million for the second quarter and the first six months of 2022, respectively), and revenues from our active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, as well as revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with former legacy Pfizer businesses/partnerships.</p>
<p><em>Remaining Performance Obligations––</em>Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totaled approximately $9 billion as of July 2, 2023, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2023 through 2026, the timing and terms of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal second quarter of 2023 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year.</p>
<p><em>Deferred Revenues––</em>Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty total $1.2 billion as of July 2, 2023, with $1.2 billion and $28 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred revenues during the first six months of 2023 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in <em>Revenues</em> as we delivered the products to our customers, partially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into amended contracts and the impact of foreign exchange. During the second quarter and first six months of 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $300 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of July 2, 2023 will be recognized in <em>Revenues</em> proportionately as we transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in <em>Revenues</em> within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in <em>Revenues</em> in 2024. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of July 2, 2023 or December 31, 2022.</p>

<h2 id="item-2.-managements-discussion-and-analysis-of-financial-condition-and-results-of-operations">ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
<p>The following MD&amp;A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in <em><a href="#item-1.-financial-statements"><u>Item 1. Financial Statements</u></a></em> in this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-our-performance-operating-environment-strategy-and-outlook">OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK</h2>
<p><strong>Our Business and Strategy</strong>––Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&amp;D and SI&amp;A to support Pfizer’s near- and longer-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently acquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See <a href="#note-13.-segment-geographic-and-other-revenue-information"><em><u>Note 13A</u></em></a>.</p>
<p>We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception and through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end R&amp;D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&amp;D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See <a href="#_bookmark10"><em><u>Note 3</u></em></a>. For a description of savings related to this program, see the <em><a href="#costs-and-expenses"><u>Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivi</u>t<u>y Initiatives</u></a></em> section within MD&amp;A<em>.</em></p>
<p>In July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing how our R&amp;D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.</p>
<p>For additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the <em>Item 1. Business</em> section and <em>Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook</em> section within MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p><strong>Our Business Development Initiatives</strong>––We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business development activities include the transactions discussed in <em><u><a href="#note-1.-basis-of-presentation-and-significant-accounting-policies">Notes</a> <a href="#note-1.-basis-of-presentation-and-significant-accounting-policies">1A</a></u></em> and <em><a href="#note-2.-acquisitions-discontinued-operations-equity-method-investment-and-research-and-development-arrangement"><u>2</u></a>,</em> including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:</p>
<p><em><u>Proposed Divestiture of Ear</u>l<u>y-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy</u> <u>Por</u>tf <u>olio</u>–</em>–In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of up to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.</p>
<p><em><u>Agreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagsh</u>ip)–</em>–In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset programs by leveraging Flagship’s ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and royalties for each successfully commercialized program.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><em><u>Termination of Collaboration Arrangement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany</u> <u>(Merck KGaA</u>)–</em>–In March 2023, it was announced that our alliance with Merck KGaA to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio (avelumab) will terminate. Effective June 30, 2023, Merck KGaA took full control of the global commercialization of Bavencio. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the current profit share will be replaced by a 15% royalty to Pfizer on net sales of Bavencio. We and Merck KGaA will continue to operationalize our respective ongoing clinical trials for Bavencio; and Merck KGaA will control all future R&amp;D activities.</p>
<p>For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 23, 2023, the filing date of our 2022 Form 10-K, see <em>Note 2</em> in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h3 id="our-second-quarter-2023-and-first-six-months-of-2023-performance">Our Second Quarter 2023 and First Six Months of 2023 Performance</h3>
<p><em><u>Revenues</u></em>––<em>Revenues</em> decreased $15.0 billion, or 54%, in the second quarter of 2023 to $12.7 billion from $27.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $14.7 billion, or 53%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $283 million, or 1%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $537 million, or 5%, operationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, and strong growth from the Vyndaqel family, partially offset by declines in Inflectra in the U.S. and Ibrance.</p>
<p>Revenues decreased $22.4 billion, or 42%, in the first six months of 2023 to $31.0 billion from $53.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $21.4 billion, or 40%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.0 billion, or 2%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines in Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%, operationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, as well as strong growth from the Vyndaqel family and Eliquis, and increased Sulperazon revenues in China in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decline in Ibrance.</p>
<p>As of August 1, 2023, on a total company basis, we forecasted revenues in 2023 of $67 billion to $70 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint from 2022 results, which we expect will also have an unfavorable impact on <em>Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income</em>. The total company expected revenue declines in 2023 are driven by an expected reduction in sales of our COVID-19 products, partially offset by expected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, anticipated new product and indication launches, and recently acquired products.</p>

<p><em><u>Income</u> f <u>rom Continuing Operations B</u>ef <u>ore Provision/(Ben</u>ef <u>i</u>t)</em> <em><u>for Taxes on Income</u></em>––The decreases in <em>Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income</em> of $9.2 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and $12.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022, were primarily due to lower revenues and an increase in <em>Selling, informational and administrative expenses,</em> partially offset by lower <em>Cost of sales</em> and net gains on equity securities in the second quarter of 2023 versus net losses recognized in the second quarter of 2022, and lower net losses on equity securities for the first six months of 2023<em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Our Operating Environment</strong>––We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges.

Risk Factors</em> sections, and the <em>Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook</em>––<em>Our Operating Environment</em> section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K and the <em><a href="#item-1a.-risk-factors"><u>Item 1A.</u></a> <a href="#item-1a.-risk-factors"><u>Risk Factors</u></a></em> section of this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p><em><u>Intellectual Proper</u>t<u>y R</u>ig<u>hts and Collaboration/Licensing R</u>ig<u>hts</u></em>––The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2023 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in- line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.</p>
<p>For additional information, see the <em>Item 1. Business––Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights</em> and the <em>Item 1A. Risk Factors––Intellectual Property Protection</em> sections of our 2022 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see <em><a href="#note-12.-contingencies-and-certain-commitments"><u>Note 12A1</u></a>.</em></p>
<p><em><u>Regulatory</u> <u>Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group Pressures</u></em>––Governments globally, as well as private third-party payers in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, proposing pricing reform or legislation, employing formularies to control costs, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing, which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid program or the federal 340B drug pricing program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B program, could have a material impact on our business. See the <em>Item 1. Business</em>––<em>Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations</em> and –– <em>Government Regulation and Price Constraints</em> and the <em>Item 1A. Risk Factors––Pricing and Reimbursement</em> sections, and the <em>Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Operating Environment</em> section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K<em>.</em></p>
<p><em><u>Impact of Recent Tornado in Rocky</u> <u>Mount, North Carolina (NC</u>)––</em>Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. The facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables—including anesthesia, analgesia, and micronutrients—which is nearly eight percent of all the sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals. The HiRise warehouse sustained major damage and all raw materials, packaging supplies and finished medicines stored within were damaged. All necessary supplies have been reordered for expedited delivery and we are actively engaging with suppliers. We are working diligently to move product stored within other areas of the facility not impacted by the event to other nearby sites for storage and to secure temporary warehouse space in the vicinity, as an interim solution, until the warehouse on the Rocky Mount campus can be rebuilt. We are also exploring alternative manufacturing locations for production across our significant manufacturing presence in the U.S. and internationally and across our partner network. After an initial assessment, there does not appear to be major damage to the production areas. We are committed to rapidly restoring full function to the site. We are providing financial support to help local communities affected by the natural disaster. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of the tornado on our business, including costs to repair and rebuild the site, inventory losses, potential losses from stock outages at the hospital/retail level, overhead costs related to the period in which the plant may be inoperable, as well as other one-time remediation and/or other incremental costs which may be necessary as we work to bring our plant back online, but we are unable to predict the impact or insurance recoveries with certainty at this time.</p>
<p><em><u>Product Supp</u>ly</em>––We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to recalls, including our voluntary recall of Chantix in 2021 and additional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022 due to the presence of nitrosamines above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit, and may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for Pfizer products.</p>
<p>Except for the recent tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first six months of 2023 and to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels; however, we continue to see heightened demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the <em>Item 1A. Risk Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks</em> section of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Economic Environment</strong>––In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. See the <em>Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook</em>––<em>The Global Economic Environment</em> section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p><em><u>COVID-19</u></em>––In response to COVID-19, we have developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty, including, subject to approval, an Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent vaccine. As part of our strategy for</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant additional investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the <em><a href="#product-developments"><u>Product Developments</u></a></em> section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 2023 and to date, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts and Paxlovid globally to government agencies and distributors. We expect Comirnaty in the U.S. will transition to traditional commercial market sales in the second half of 2023, triggered by the expiration of current contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, we expect sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets to generally be under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to generally transition to commercial markets starting in 2024. For Paxlovid, we expect to transition to traditional commercial markets in the second half of 2023 rather than significant government purchases. We anticipate this transition in the U.S. to occur in the second half of 2023, though at this point we have not yet agreed on a transition plan with the U.S. government. We also remain committed to helping ensure broad and equitable access to our COVID-19 products to eligible patients around the world. Revenues from our COVID-19 products are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024. While patient demand for our COVID-19 products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected to be fulfilled by existing supply of products that were delivered to governments and recorded as revenues in 2022. As of August 1, 2023, we forecasted Comirnaty revenues of approximately $13.5 billion in 2023, down 64% from actual 2022 results, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, and Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion in 2023, down 58% from actual 2022 results. These forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, patient demand, which could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the predominant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during 2023, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or is treated with an oral antiviral treatment, the number of doses per vaccinated person per year, number of symptomatic infections, market share of Comirnaty and Paxlovid and the timing for transitioning Comirnaty and Paxlovid to commercial markets in the U.S.</p>

<p><em><u>Russia/Ukraine Conflict</u></em>––Our global operations may be impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For both the six months ended July 2, 2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets, and while we are monitoring the effects of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to evolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, are difficult to predict at this time. While as of now, we do not anticipate any significant negative impacts on our business from this conflict, continued regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential additional sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, any retaliatory measures taken by Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, and actions by our customers or suppliers, including financial institutions, in response to such measures could adversely affect the global macroeconomic environment, our operations, currency exchange rates and financial markets, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of operations. For additional information on our response to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as risks associated with the conflict, see the <em>Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations</em> section and the <em>Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook</em> section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Emerging markets revenues decreased $6.1 billion, or 45%, in the first six months of 2023 to $7.3 billion from $13.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $5.6 billion, or 42%, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 3%. The operational decrease in emerging markets was primarily driven by declines from Comirnaty, partially offset by growth from Paxlovid, as well as increased Sulperazon revenues in the first quarter of 2023 largely driven by demand in China.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Deductions</strong>––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.</p>
<p>The following presents information about revenue deductions:</p>

<h4 id="cost-of-sales"><u>Cost of Sales</u></h4>
<p><em>Cost of sales</em> decreased $5.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and $10.5 billion in the first six months of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a reduction of $4.3 billion in the second quarter and $9.8 billion in the first six months due to lower sales of Comirnaty and, to a much lesser extent, by lower write-offs of approximately $300 million in the second quarter and $240 million in the first six months for Comirnaty inventory that exceeded or was expected to exceed its approved shelf-life prior to being used; and</p></li>
<li><p>a reduction of $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $630 million in the first six months due to lower sales of Paxlovid.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The decrease in <em>Cost of sales</em> as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and in the first six months of 2023 was mainly driven by favorable changes in sales mix, including lower sales of Comirnaty, and to a much lesser extent by lower write-offs for Comirnaty discussed above, partially offset by lower sales of Paxlovid.</p>
<h4 id="selling-informational-and-administrative-expenses"><u>Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses</u></h4>
<p><em>Selling, informational and administrative</em> expenses increased $448 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increases of $410 million in the second quarter and $970 million in the first six months in marketing and promotional expenses ($280 million in the second quarter and $560 million in the first six months for recently acquired and launched products, and $130 million in the second quarter and $410 million in the first six months for the expected Paxlovid commercial launch); and</p></li>
<li><p>increases of $130 million in the second quarter and $210 million in the first six months in our liability to be paid to participants of our supplemental savings plan,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>decreases of $120 million in the second quarter and $170 million in the first six months due to a lower provision for U.S. healthcare reform fees associated with lower sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="research-and-development-expenses"><u>Research and Development Expenses</u></h4>
<p><em>Research and development</em> expenses decreased $167 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower spending of $190 million on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19; and</p></li>
<li><p>a decrease of $100 million in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, partially offset by:</p></li>
<li><p>increased investments of $130 million to develop recently acquired assets and certain vaccine programs, as well as activities to support upcoming product launches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Research and development</em> expenses increased $37 million in the first six months of 2023, primarily driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increased costs of $530 million to develop recently acquired assets and certain vaccine programs, and other late stage clinical programs as well as activities to support upcoming product launches,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower spending of $390 million on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19; and</p></li>
<li><p>a decrease of $80 million in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer’s common stock.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="acquired-in-process-research-and-development-expenses"><u>Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses</u></h4>
<p><em>Acquired in-process research and development</em> expenses decreased $301 million in the first six months of 2023, primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of (i) an upfront payment to Biohaven and a premium paid on our equity investment in Biohaven totaling $263 million and (ii) a $76 million premium paid on our equity investment in BioNTech to develop a potential mRNA vaccine against shingles, both recorded in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<h4 id="amortization-of-intangible-assets"><u>Amortization of Intangible Assets</u></h4>
<p>Amortization of intangible assets increased $362 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $630 million in the first six months of 2023, primarily as a result of amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT, partially offset by fully amortized assets.</p>
<h4 id="restructuring-charges-and-other-costs-associated-with-acquisitions-and-cost-reductionproductivity-initiatives"><u>Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivi</u>ty <u>Initiatives</u></h4>
<p><em>Transforming to a More Focused Company Program</em>––For a description of our program, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see <em><a href="#_bookmark10"><u>Note 3A</u></a>.</em> The program savings discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations. In connection with restructuring our corporate enabling functions, we achieved gross cost savings of $1.0 billion, or net cost savings, excluding</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, in the two year period from 2021 through 2022. In connection with transforming our commercial go-to market strategy, we expect net cost savings of $1.4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2022 through 2024. In connection with manufacturing network optimization, we expect net cost savings of $550 million to be achieved primarily from 2020 through 2023. In connection with optimizing our end-to-end R&amp;D operations, we expect net cost savings of $2.3 billion to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2025.</p>
<p>Certain qualifying costs for this program in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non- GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the <em><a href="#non-gaap-financial-measure-adjusted-income"><u>Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income</u></a></em> section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In addition to this program, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.</p>
<h4 id="other-incomedeductionsnet"><u>Other (Income)/Deductions—Net</u></h4>
<p>The favorable period-over-period change of $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, was primarily driven by (i) net gains on equity securities recognized in the second quarter of 2023 versus net losses in the second quarter of 2022, and (ii) net periodic benefit credits associated with pension and postretirement plans recorded in the second quarter of 2023 versus net periodic benefit costs recorded in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The favorable period-over-period change of $1.4 billion for the first six months of 2023, compared to the first six months of 2022, was primarily driven by (i) lower net losses on equity securities, (ii) higher dividend income and (iii) lower net interest expense, partially offset by (iv) intangible asset impairment charges recorded in the first six months of 2023.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-vaccine-products">COVID-19 Vaccine Products</h3>
<p><em><u>U.S.</u></em>––In April 2023, in order to simplify the vaccination schedule for most individuals, the FDA amended an EUA for the emergency use of the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5), which has been developed in collaboration with BioNTech, for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 6 months of age and older. In the U.S., the original monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is no longer authorized for emergency use or CDC-recommended, although Comirnaty remains a licensed vaccine. This decision relates entirely to the FDA’s strategy to harmonize COVID-19 vaccines and is not indicative of any safety-related</p>
<p>signals or concerns.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>In February 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for approval of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)) as a primary series and booster dose(s) for individuals 12 years of age and older.</p>
<p>In June 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies have submitted a regulatory application to the FDA for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<h2 id="non-gaap-financial-measure-adjusted-income">NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME</h2>
<p>Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Measure Definition Relevance of Metrics to Our Business Performance</p>
<p>Adjusted income</p>
<p>Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, Adjusted research and development expenses and Adjusted other (income)/deductions<em>––</em>net</p>
<p>Adjusted diluted EPS</p>
<p><em>Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders</em><sup>(a)</sup> before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items</p>
<p><em>Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses</em> and <em>Other (income)/deductions––net</em><sup>(a)</sup>, each before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are components of the Adjusted income measure</p>
<p><em>EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders––diluted</em><sup>(a)</sup> before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provides investors useful information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>evaluate the normal recurring operational activities, and their components, on a comparable year- over-year basis</p></li>
<li><p>assist in modeling expected future</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>performance on a normalized basis</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provides investors insight into the way we manage our budgeting and forecasting, how we evaluate and manage our recurring operations and how we reward and compensate our senior management<sup>(b)</sup></p></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>(a)</sup> Most directly comparable GAAP measure.</p>
<p>(b) The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted metrics, one of which is Adjusted diluted EPS (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes), which is derived from Adjusted income and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for acquired IPR&amp;D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R&amp;D pipeline performance, as measured by four metrics, and performance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors.</p>
<p>Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of <em>Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders</em>, components of <em>Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders</em> and <em>EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders—diluted</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&amp;D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.</p>
<h3 id="adjusted-income-and-adjusted-diluted-eps">Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS</h3>
<p><em><u>Amortization of Intangible Assets</u></em>—Adjusted income excludes all amortization of intangible assets.</p>
<p><em><u>Acquisition-Related Items</u></em>—Adjusted income excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.</p>
<p><em><u>Discontinued Operations</u></em>—Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><em><u>Certain S</u>ig<u>n</u>if <u>icant Items</u></em>—Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities, and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell.

<h2 id="analysis-of-financial-condition-liquidity-capital-resources-and-market-risk">ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Our historically robust operating cash flows, which we expect to continue, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source. We believe as a result of this, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see our <a href="#_bookmark6"><em><u>Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows</u></em></a>, <a href="#_bookmark4"><em><u>Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets</u></em></a>, <a href="#_bookmark5"><em><u>Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equi</u>ty</em></a>, and the <em><a href="#_bookmark30"><u>Ana</u>l<u>ysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows</u></a></em> within MD&amp;A.

<p>For information about our diverse sources of funds, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual and other obligations, global economic conditions, market risk and LIBOR, see the <em>Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk</em> section within MD&amp;A in our 2022 Form 10-K. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see <a href="#note-12.-contingencies-and-certain-commitments"><em><u>Note 12B</u></em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Debt Issuance</strong>––In May 2023, we completed a public offering of $31 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes as part of the financing for our proposed acquisition of Seagen. The net proceeds have been invested in short-term investments in a combination of money market funds and available-for- sale debt securities until the completion of the proposed acquisition. See <em><a href="#_bookmark14"><u>Notes 7A</u></a></em> and <a href="#_bookmark15"><em><u>7D</u></em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Ratings</strong>––The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&amp;P and Moody’s. In March 2023, following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Seagen, Moody’s changed the outlook on our long-term debt to Negative; S&amp;P downgraded our short-term rating from A-1+ to A-1.</p>

<p><strong>Debt Capacity––Lines of Credit</strong>––As of July 2, 2023, we had access to a $7 billion committed U.S. revolving credit facility, which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our commercial paper borrowings. Lenders under this facility have approximately $700 million of commitments maturing in November 2026 and $6.3 billion of commitments maturing in November 2027. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facility, our lenders have provided us an additional $304 million in lines of credit, of which $274 million expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of July 2, 2023.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><strong>Capital Allocation Framework</strong>––Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to facilitate the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&amp;D investments and business development activities and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to finance the proposed acquisition of Seagen substantially through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. See <em><a href="#note-1.-basis-of-presentation-and-significant-accounting-policies"><u>Note 1A</u></a></em> and the <em><a href="#item-1a.-risk-factors"><u>Item 1A.

We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified below, as well as those discussed in the <em>Item 1A. Risk Factors</em> section in our 2022 Form 10-K, the <em><a href="#item-1a.-risk-factors"><u>Item 1A. Risk Factors</u></a></em> section of this Form 10-Q and within MD&amp;A.

<h2 id="proposed-acquisition-of-seagen">PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SEAGEN</h2>

<p>On March 12, 2023, we entered into a merger agreement with Seagen. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. As a result, there is no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe or at all. In addition, Pfizer may be required to pay Seagen a reverse termination fee of approximately $2.22 billion, subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated by either party as a result of certain antitrust and/or foreign direct investment law-related conditions. Any failure to consummate the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all could prevent Pfizer from receiving the expected benefits from the acquisition. See the <em><a href="#overview-of-our-performance-operating-environment-strategy-and-outlook"><u>Overview of Our Pe</u>rf <u>ormance, Operating Environment, Strate</u>g<u>y and Outlook—Our Business Development</u></a> <a href="#overview-of-our-performance-operating-environment-strategy-and-outlook"><u>Initiatives</u></a></em> and the <em><a href="#forward-looking-information-and-factors-that-may-affect-future-results"><u>Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May</u> <u>A</u>ff <u>ect Future Results</u></a></em> sections within MD&amp;A.</p>

<p>Pfizer has expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and expenses related to the acquisition of Seagen, many of which must be paid regardless of whether the acquisition is consummated. For example, such time, resources and expenses will be incurred in connection with seeking regulatory approvals for the transaction. We intend to finance a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, plus additional short-term indebtedness to be issued prior to the acquisition, which indebtedness may limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position.</p>

<p>We have established significant growth goals, which we plan to achieve, in part, by accelerating revenue growth by not only advancing our own product pipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various forms of business development activities, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. Our proposed acquisition of Seagen is part of that accelerated revenue growth plan. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. The success of our business development activities is dependent on the availability and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy or waive closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes, or at all, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and commercialize acquired products. Pursuing, executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings or limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position. The success of our business development transactions depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><span id="_bookmark41" class="anchor"></span>outside of our control, including the possibility that the expected benefits from such transactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from acquired products and businesses. We may fail to generate expected revenue growth for our existing products, product pipeline and acquired products or businesses or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings, such as those expected with respect to Seagen, within expected time frames or at all, which may impact our ability to meet our growth objectives. In certain transactions, we may agree to provide certain transition services for an extended period of time, which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from transactions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities through, among other things, due diligence, we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position.</p>

<p>EXECUTIVE OFFICER CASH SEVERANCE POLICY</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (the “<u>Company</u>”) will not enter into any new employment agreement, severance agreement or separation agreement with any executive officer of the Company or establish any new severance plan or policy covering any executive officer of the Company, in each case that provides for Cash Severance Benefits exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the executive officer’s Base Salary and Target Bonus, without seeking stockholder ratification of such agreement, plan or policy.1</p>
<p>For purposes of this policy:</p>
<p>“<u>Cash Severance Benefits</u>” means cash payments: (i) in respect of the termination of the executive officer’s employment; (ii) to secure an agreement not to compete with the Company; or (iii) to offset any tax liability in respect of any of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, “Cash Severance Benefits” do not include (a) the grant, payment, vesting, acceleration or other handling of long term incentive awards granted under the Company’s stockholder-approved plans, including without limitation the Pfizer Inc. 2014 Stock Plan, the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan or any successor plans, (b) payment of deferred compensation, earned retirement benefits or other vested employee benefits, in each case consistent with normal practices, provided under the Company’s qualified or nonqualified retirement plans or employee benefit plans, (c) the provision of perquisites, insurance, disability, health and welfare plan coverage, outplacement or retraining and other non-cash benefits generally available to similarly-situated employees, (d) any notice pay or interest required to be paid pursuant to the terms of any Company plan or policy between the termination date and the payment date, (e) any unpaid bonus for any previously completed performance period required to be paid pursuant to the terms of any Company plan or policy, (f) accrued but unpaid base salary or vacation pay through the termination date and reimbursement for any expenses validly incurred prior to the termination date or (g) any payment in respect of the executive officer’s bonus for the year of termination (prorated based on the executive officer’s completed service during the annual performance period).</p>
<p>“<u>Base Salary</u>” means the annualized base salary in effect immediately prior to an executive officer’s termination date, (or, if higher, the highest annualized base salary in effect during the 12-month period prior to the termination date).</p>
<p>“<u>Target Bonus</u>” means the executive officer’s target annual incentive bonus in effect for the year of termination.</p>
<p>1 Exclusions apply for pre-existing agreements and arrangements assumed by the Company in the context of a corporate transaction.</p>
