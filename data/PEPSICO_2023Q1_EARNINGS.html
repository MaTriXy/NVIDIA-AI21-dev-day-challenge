<p><strong>PURCHASE, N.Y. - April 25, 2023</strong> - PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the first quarter 2023.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent),” said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.</p>
<p>Laguarta continued, “Our results demonstrate that the investments we have made to become an even Faster, even Stronger, and even Better organization by Winning with pep+ are laying the foundation for durable and sustainable growth. We remain committed to our strategic agenda and will continue to invest in our people, brands, supply chain, go-to-market systems, and digitization initiatives to build competitive advantages and win in the marketplace.”</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including “Organic revenue growth,” “Core” and “Constant currency,” and to “Guidance and Outlook” for additional information regarding PepsiCo’s full-year 2023 financial guidance. PepsiCo provides guidance on a non- GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange and commodity mark-to-market net impacts. Please refer to PepsiCo’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 (Q1 2023 Form 10-Q) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for additional information regarding PepsiCo’s financial results.</p>

<li><p><em>Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the volume change shown here differs from the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth disclosed in the Organic Revenue Growth Rates table on page A-8, due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.</em></p></li>

<p><em>n/m - Not meaningful due to the impact of impairment and other charges in 2022. Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.</em></p>
<p><em>Organic revenue and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of “Organic revenue growth,” “Core” and “Constant currency.”</em></p>
<p><span id="_bookmark0" class="anchor"></span>The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity mark-to-market net impacts.</p>
<p>For fiscal year 2023, the Company now expects to deliver 8 percent organic revenue growth (previously 6 percent), and 9 percent core constant currency EPS growth (previously 8 percent).</p>
<p>Consistent with its previous guidance for 2023, the Company continues to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and</p></li>
<li><p>Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.7 billion, comprised of dividends of $6.7 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Company continues to expect an approximate 2-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.</p>
<p>This assumption and the guidance above imply 2023 core EPS of $7.27 (previously $7.20), a 7 percent increase (previously 6 percent) compared to 2022 core EPS of $6.79.</p>

<p><strong><u>Non-GAAP Measures</u></strong></p>
<p>In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with</p>
<p>U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.</p>
<p>We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein.</p>
<p>Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Glossary</u></strong></p>
<p>We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:</p>
<p>Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.</p>
<p>Bottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.</p>
<p>Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.</p>
<p>Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:</p>
<p><em>Mark-to-market net impact</em></p>
<p>Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.</p>
<p><em>Restructuring and impairment charges</em></p>
<p>Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.</p>
<p><em>Acquisition and divestiture-related charges</em></p>
<p>Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.</p>
<p><em>Gain associated with the Juice Transaction</em></p>
<p>We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.</p>
<p><em>Impairment and other charges/credits</em></p>
<p>We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.</p>
<p><em>Russia-Ukraine conflict charges</em></p>
<p>In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.</p>
<p><em>Brand portfolio impairment charges</em></p>
<p>We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.</p>
<p><em>Other impairment charges</em></p>
<p>We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p><em>Pension and retiree medical-related impact</em></p>
<p>Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.</p>
<p><em>Tax benefit related to the IRS audit</em></p>
<p>We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.</p>
<p><em>Tax expense related to the TCJ Act</em></p>
<p>Tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.</p>
<p>Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.</p>
<p>Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53<sup>rd</sup> reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.</p>
<p><em>2023 guidance</em></p>
<p>Our 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53<sup>rd</sup> reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.</p>
