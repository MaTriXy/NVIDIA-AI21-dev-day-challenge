<p><strong>PART I</strong></p>
<p><strong>ITEM 1. BUSINESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats.</p>
<p>We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com.</a> We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud- based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).</p>
<p>Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com.</a> Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from our website free of charge, as well as from the SEC website at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">www.sec.gov.</a> The information posted to our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h1 id="offerings">OFFERINGS</h1>
<p>For four decades, Adobe’s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments engage and interact across all types of media. We deliver tools and services to empower individuals to create, collaborate and express their vision, transform businesses with compelling, personalized experiences in streamlined workflows and connect communities with new levels of collaboration.</p>
<p>While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and solutions, we focus our investments in two areas of strategic growth:</p>
<p><strong>Digital Media.</strong> We provide products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our Digital Media segment is centered around Adobe Creative Cloud</p>
<p>and Adobe Document Cloud, which include Adobe Express, Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and many more products, offering a variety of tools for creative professionals, communicators and other consumers. This is the core of what we have delivered to users for decades, and we have continually evolved and expanded our business model to provide our customers with a range of flexible solutions that allow them to reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device and on projects of all types.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Experience.</strong> We provide an integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite. The foundation of our offering is Adobe Experience Platform, which provides businesses and brands with an open and extensible system for customer experience management that transforms customer data into robust customer profiles that update in real time and uses insights driven by artificial intelligence (“AI”) to enable the delivery of personalized digital experiences across various channels in milliseconds.</p>
<p>With the creative power of our Digital Media business and the data-based tools of our Digital Experience business, we are able to offer a comprehensive suite of offerings to our customers. Through these tools and services, we help our customers effectively make, manage, monetize and mobilize their content across channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop. We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both of these areas, where our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, as people seek new ways to create, collaborate and communicate and businesses continue to invest in digital transformation. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.</p>
<h1 id="segments">SEGMENTS</h1>
<p>Our business is organized into three reportable segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digital Media;</p></li>
<li><p>Digital Experience; and</p></li>
<li><p>Publishing and Advertising.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These segments provide Adobe’s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities further described below, and our legacy products and solutions are contained within the third segment, Publishing and Advertising.</p>
<h1 id="market-overview">MARKET OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2023 and beyond for each of our segments. <em>See the section titled “Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report and Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment information.</em></p>
<h2 id="digital-media">Digital Media</h2>
<p><em>Opportunity</em></p>
<p>In today’s digital world, content is fueling the global economy and design and creativity have never been more relevant, providing a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Everyone has a story to tell, and they need the tools, services and capabilities at their fingertips to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In a creator economy that is continually expanding, creators are looking for tools to help them easily make and share unique and beautiful content with speed and ease. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team sport that is redefining productivity, making collaboration even more critical to every company’s success. We believe Adobe is in a strong position to address these trends with innovation that will democratize creativity, empowering individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enabling more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, a subscription service that allows members to use our creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists, designers, developers, students and administrators, to knowledge workers, marketers, educators, enthusiasts, communicators and</p>
<p>consumers. Users can choose between the speed and ease of use of Adobe Express, our task-based, template-first web and mobile application, or the greater power and precision of our flagship Creative Cloud applications. Our customers rely on our products for content creation, photo editing, design, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and more. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by advancing every creative category across devices and the web, expanding content-first, task-based creativity with Adobe Express and 3D and immersive content creation with Substance 3D, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.</p>
<p>Our Digital Media segment also includes our Adobe Document Cloud business, a unified, cloud-based document services platform, which integrates Adobe’s pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. We have the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share, collaborate and engage with documents. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy. There are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.</p>
<p><em>Strategy</em></p>
<p>Our goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer a range of products and services that allow individuals, teams, small and medium businesses, enterprises and government institutions, including both professionals and enthusiasts, to design and deliver content seamlessly. With content creation, consumption, collaboration and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth to make our creative applications more frictionless and accessible, and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.</p>
<p>We continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering anyone, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit, schedule and share content quickly and easily using Adobe Express, which employs powerful capabilities from our flagship products like Photoshop, Premiere and Acrobat to deliver the best of Adobe to customers at any level. We are continuing to integrate collaboration capabilities into our applications and workflows such as our native integration of Frame.io’s review and approval capabilities into Premiere Pro and After Effects. Similarly, our new Share for Review feature in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign provides an efficient way for creators to seamlessly request, manage and view feedback from stakeholders that makes exporting to other formats, emailing files, tracking versions and keeping track feedback across different channels obsolete. We are expanding the capabilities of Creative Cloud on the web with improvements to our public beta web versions of Photoshop and Illustrator, which allow subscribers to edit and review their files directly in their browser. Other new features and solutions introduced in our products include Substance 3D Modeler, a new desktop and VR application for creating 3D objects; AI-powered quick actions and social media content scheduling in Adobe Express; direct video upload from select cameras to Frame.io with Camera to Cloud; and improved AI-powered neural filters and content-aware editing in Photoshop and Lightroom. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications.</p>
<p>We are pursuing new ways to inspire, empower and connect the creative community, such as through our Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including libraries of creative assets, such as Adobe Stock and Adobe Fonts; mobile-first apps, such as Lightroom Mobile; and Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under “Principal Products and Services.”</p>
<p>In our Creative Cloud business, we employ our product-led growth strategy to minimize the friction of customer interactions and drive positive product experiences, which results in increasing customer adoption, conversion, expansion and loyalty. We also continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to migrate our customers to higher-value offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. We use a data-driven operating model and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to drive and optimize customer awareness, engagement and licensing of our creative products and services at every stop of the customer journey through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual</p>
<p>subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Adobe Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model and product-led growth strategy to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval, copywriting, social media marketing or other social content. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with existing users, attract new customers and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.</p>
<p>In our Adobe Document Cloud business, we expect to drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to employ our product-led growth strategy, deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web’s functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat and integrate Adobe Acrobat Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces. We also intend to drive innovation with Adobe Sensei, our cross-platform AI and machine learning technology, to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Acrobat Sign APIs, accelerate Document Cloud adoption through direct sales, and leverage diversified go-to-market motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a data-driven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.</p>
<p>As our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features “Liquid Mode” to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe Acrobat Sign also provides a green alternative to costly, paper-based solutions and offers a modern, convenient solution for customers to digitally manage their documents, automate processes and contract workflows. We believe that by using Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Acrobat Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.</p>
<h2 id="digital-experience">Digital Experience</h2>
<p><em>Opportunity</em></p>
<p>Digital transformation is a macro trend that affects every business, government and educational institution today—every business is a digital business. Consumers today buy experiences, not just products, and they demand personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, driving business-to-business (“B2B”) companies to deliver equally engaging and seamless experiences as business-to-consumer (“B2C”) companies and enterprise brands to adopt “business-to- everyone” (“B2E”) mindsets. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world’s leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>Adobe Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses by providing exceptional experiences to their customers via a comprehensive suite of solutions. We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is a large and growing opportunity and we are in position to help businesses and enterprises invest in solutions that aid their goals to transform how they engage with their customers and constituents digitally.</p>
<p><em>Strategy</em></p>
<p>Our goal is to be a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for delivering digital experiences and enabling digital transformation. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications and services are designed to manage customer journeys, enable personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. The Adobe Experience Platform further strengthens our differentiation by offering a way to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.</p>
<p>Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the following strategic growth pillars:</p>
<ul>

These AI services help provide domain-specific intelligence in areas such as attribution and automated insights, customer journey management, lead management, sentiment analysis, one-click personalization, enhanced anomaly detection and more.

<p>Adobe Experience Cloud also offers an open platform and ecosystem through the Adobe Experience Platform, AI services, and developer services through Adobe I/O. Adobe Experience Platform is the foundation of our Adobe Experience Cloud products, with an open system that transforms user data from across Adobe solutions and third-party software into robust customer profiles.

We also intend to focus on personalization at scale, customer engagement, growth within existing customer accounts and product differentiation. We are continuing to add new services, functionality and features to our current offerings. Some examples include a new algorithm in Adobe Target that utilizes machine learning to provide recommendations and tools that allow developers to optimize page load performance and deliver personalized experiences more quickly. We are also delivering new and improved integrations, such as increased synergy between our Experience Cloud products and Creative Cloud and Adobe Acrobat Sign.

Across our business, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide.

Our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions face competition from large, established companies, including large enterprise software, internet and database management companies, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors, and new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to customers, generally through a web browser, while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers.

<p>Our Publishing and Advertising product offerings face competition from large-scale publishing systems and XML-based publishing companies, as well as lower-end desktop publishing products. Our web conferencing product faces competition from a number of established products from other large software companies.

<p>through these programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly from the combination of Adobe technology and the deep customer context that our global partners represent.</p>
<p><em>Customer Success Account Management</em></p>
<p>Adobe Customer Solutions provides Customer Success Managers, who work with enterprise and commercial customers on an ongoing basis to understand their current and future business needs, promote faster solution adoption and align product capabilities to customers’ business objectives to maximize the return on their investment in Adobe’s offerings. We engage customers to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge and proven success strategies based on our extensive engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customer-focused outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Technical Support</em></p>
<p>Adobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription entitlement and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide customers with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>technical support on the products customers have purchased from Adobe;</p></li>
<li><p>“how to” help in using our products; and</p></li>
<li><p>product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is typically one to three years.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We provide product support through our support organization that includes several regional and global support centers, supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone, chat, web, social media and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.</p>
<p>Certain consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support, to assist with easy adoption of their products. Support for some products and in some countries may vary. For enterprise customers with greater support needs, we offer personalized service options through Premium Services options, delivered by global support centers and technical account managers who can also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business-critical deployments.</p>
<p>We also offer delivery assurance, technical support and enablement services to partners and developer organizations. We provide developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.</p>
<p><em>Digital Learning Services</em></p>
<p>Adobe Customer Solutions offers a comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services to assist our customer and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Experience, Digital Media and other legacy products and solutions. Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on <a href="http://www.training.adobe.com/">www.training.adobe.com.</a> Adobe Digital Learning Services also has an extensive portfolio of fee-based learning programs including a wide range of traditional classroom, virtual and on-demand training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals and partners across the globe.</p>
<p>These core offerings are complemented by our custom learning services, which support our largest enterprise customers and their unique requirements. Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="investments">Investments</h2>
<p>From time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for strategic purposes, as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies and expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.</p>
<h1 id="product-development">PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<p>A continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new solutions due to the speed of technological change that characterizes the software industry. We develop our software internally, as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs</p>
<p>developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.</p>
<h1 id="protecting-and-licensing-our-products">PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS</h1>
<p>We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have U.S. and international patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.</p>
<p>We license our desktop software and mobile apps to users under ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure and transfer. Similarly, cloud products and services are provided to users under ‘click through’ or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use. Our enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as SaaS or Managed Services.</p>
<p>Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.</p>
<h1 id="human-capital">HUMAN CAPITAL</h1>
<p>Our culture is built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation and performance, which spur the Company’s success. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and benefits to support our employees’ wellbeing, and foster their growth and development. As of December 2, 2022, we employed 29,239 people, of which 51% were in the United States and 49% were in our international locations. During fiscal 2022, our total attrition rate was 11.7%. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good. Our employee listening program helps us understand employee sentiment on a wide range of topics throughout the employee lifecycle, providing insights that inform our decisions about employee programs, talent risks, management opportunities, employee networks and more. In fiscal 2022, 79% of our employees participated in our most recent engagement survey.</p>
<p>We encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>Adobe For All is our vision to advance diversity, equity and inclusion across the Company. We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural background or religious belief. As of December 2, 2022, women represented 34.6% of our global employees, and underrepresented minorities (“URMs,” defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 11.7% of our U.S. employees. To continue to improve employee representation, we have declared a set of aspirational goals for women in leadership positions globally, underrepresented minorities in leadership positions in the United States and overall Black representation.</p>
<p>We have a three-pillar strategy to grow the diversity of our workforce over time, on which we have continued to drive progress during fiscal 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Workforce</em>: We take actions to improve the hiring, retention and promotion of a more diverse workforce to achieve our aspirational goals. In fiscal 2022, we sourced candidates from a variety of conferences and partnerships, such as AfroTech, AdColor, BreakLine, HBCU 20x20 and Management Leadership for Tomorrow. We have continued to develop and invest in our partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic- serving institutions. We are investing in the success of underrepresented candidates and employees through mentoring, leadership, employee and internship programs and career coaching.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Workplace</em>: We are building an inclusive environment that inspires a sense of belonging and encourages people to be their authentic selves. We continue to support our employee resource groups to create community for employees from underrepresented groups. Our Taking Action initiative is focused on accelerating the representation, development and success of Adobe’s Black employees and other underrepresented groups. We host annual learning events, including our Juneteenth Global Day of Learning and our Adobe for All Week events.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ecosystem</em>: We strive to bring progress on diversity to our brand, products, partnerships, community engagement and the vendors we use. We collaborate with industry peers to advance diversity across multiple dimensions, including through our participation in the CEO Action on Diversity &amp; Inclusion, The Valuable 500, the Ascend 5-Point Action Agenda and ParityPledge. In fiscal 2022, we launched the Adobe Equity and Advancement Initiative, a multi-faceted grantmaking program to support non-profit organizations, and we continued to invest in our Supplier Diversity program to purchase goods and services from businesses that are certified as majority-owned and operated by underrepresented groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We invest in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair compensation. We define pay parity as ensuring that employees in the same job and location are paid fairly regardless of their gender or ethnicity. In fiscal 2022, we again achieved global gender pay parity and U.S. URM and non-URM pay parity. We continue to monitor our progress to ensure that we are creating a culture that fairly rewards and recognizes the contributions of all employees.</p>
<p>Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at adobe.com/diversity. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2 id="compensation-benefits-and-wellbeing">Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing</h2>
<p>We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall wellbeing. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs for all employees include base pay, short-term incentives and opportunities for long-term incentives. We believe this alignment, whether through equity awards issued by Adobe or employee participation in our employee stock purchase plan, provides employee shareholders with meaningfully deeper connections to Adobe and contributes to the Company's long-term success. Our wellbeing and benefit programs focus on four key pillars: physical, emotional, financial and community. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, generous time-off and leave and retirement and financial support. We provide emotional wellbeing services through our Employee Assistance Program and a variety of interactive apps. Our wellness reimbursement of up to $600 per year for each eligible employee, lifestyle coaching, global wellbeing speaker series and ergonomic programs help to support employees’ physical and emotional wellbeing. In addition, our financial education and financial wellness coaches offer employees tools and resources to reach their personal financial goals. To build community, we bring together our employees through onsite events, messaging forums and our Employee Networks to share stories and engage with one another.</p>
<p>In response to supporting employees after the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. This includes a hybrid work schedule for our employees and implementing resources and tools for them to be successful, including the global expansion of dependent care programs to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities. We provide up to 20 working days per calendar year of paid time off for employees who cannot work due to circumstances related to pandemic or natural disaster and company-wide global wellbeing days for employees to take a break from work and take care of themselves. Additionally, we introduced “Let’s Talk” and healing sessions to support employees facing challenging circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="future-of-work">Future of Work</h2>
<p>Digital transformation and the COVID-19 pandemic have fundamentally changed how people work, and we are leaning into digital-first workflows, tools and resources to enable us to be productive, wherever we are. We also believe in the value of people being together—fostering trust, relationships and collaboration and innovation. Over the past year, we have been evolving to a hybrid model, in which employees who are assigned to an office can divide their work between the office and home about half the time. We are actively piloting, testing and iterating our approach to support new ways of working and evolving the employee experience.</p>
<h2 id="growth-and-development">Growth and Development</h2>
<p>At Adobe, employees are given the opportunity to drive their own careers. The Global Talent Development team creates programs to support leaders, managers and employees in their career growth and personal development. In addition to the content created in house, employees also have access to on-demand content via several industry-leading learning platforms. Through Adobe’s Learning Fund, employees are eligible to receive up to $11,000 per year toward university and short-term learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Adobe is committed to enabling a culture that celebrates talent sharing, career development and agility across the Company. We post all roles internally first before sharing them externally and have made several technology enhancements to make the internal job search easier for employees. We also provide forums for managers and employees to have regular conversations about their career and contributions throughout the year.</p>

<h1 id="item-1a.-risk-factors">ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h1>
<p>As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.</p>
<h2 id="risks-related-to-our-ability-to-grow-our-business">Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business</h2>
<h3 id="the-markets-in-which-we-participate-are-intensely-competitive-and-if-we-cannot-continue-to-develop-acquire-market-and-offer-new-products-and-services-or-enhancements-to-existing-products-and-services-that-meet-customer-requirements-our-operating-results-could-suffer.">The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.</h3>
<p>The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, new technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers.</p>
<p>Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result could harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.</p>
<p><em><a href="#competition">For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in whic</a>h <a href="#competition">we operate, see the section titled “Competition” contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.</a></em></p>
<h3 id="introduction-of-new-technology-could-harm-our-business-and-results-of-operations.">Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.</h3>
<p>The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. As new technology is developed, integration of our products and services with one another and other companies’ offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is also partly reliant on third parties. If any disruptive technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed.</p>
<p>The introduction of, or limitations on, certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products and our business operations. For example, some of our products and services, including those marketed or licensed through adobe.com, rely on tracking, third-party cookies or other identifiers to help our customers more effectively advertise and detect and prevent fraudulent activity. However, consumers can, with increasing ease, implement technologies to limit the ability to collect and use data to deliver or advertise services. Increased use of methods to control the use of these technologies through customers’ browsers, operating systems, device settings or “ad-blocking” software or applications may harm our business.</p>
<h3 id="we-may-not-realize-the-anticipated-benefits-of-past-or-future-investments-or-acquisitions-and-integration-of-acquisitions-may-disrupt-our-business-and-management.">We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.</h3>
<p>We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;</p></li>
<li><p>difficulty in, and the cost of, effectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel of the acquired business;</p></li>
<li><p>potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our offerings;</p></li>
<li><p>entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;</p></li>
<li><p>disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges;</p></li>
<li><p>inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;</p></li>
<li><p>inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;</p></li>
<li><p>inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;</p></li>
<li><p>incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;</p></li>
<li><p>elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;</p></li>
<li><p>additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational corporation;</p></li>
<li><p>difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;</p></li>
<li><p>impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;</p></li>
<li><p>failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;</p></li>
<li><p>exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;</p></li>
<li><p>incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;</p></li>
<li><p>inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;</p></li>
<li><p>inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay prevent or impose conditions on such acquisitions;</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky. If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction, including the pending acquisition of Figma, Inc., or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.</p>
<p>Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments. For example, a number of countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively impact our business and financial results.</p>

<p>The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.</p>

<p>We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Adobe increases our ability to enter new categories, launch new and innovative products to better serve our customers and expand our customer base. Our brands may be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to create or disseminate newsworthy content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion (e.g., “DeepFakes”), by the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and expeditiously to such uses of our products and services. Such uses of our products and services may also cause us to face claims related to defamation, rights of publicity and privacy, illegal content, misinformation and personal injury torts. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products or services or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our business and financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, government regulation designed to address DeepFakes could adversely impact our product offerings.</p>

<p>Social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow adoption of AI in our products and services. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets and machine learning models,</p>
<p>development of new approaches and processes to provide attribution or remuneration to content creators and building systems that enable creatives to have greater control over the use of their work in the development of AI, which may be costly and could impact our profit margin if we decide to expand generative AI into all our product offerings. Developing, testing, and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems.</p>

<p>We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, a large volume of which is hosted by third- party service providers. A security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of this data. Unauthorized access to or loss or disclosure of data stored by Adobe or our service providers may occur through physical break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party, software vulnerabilities or coding errors, employee mistakes, theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee or customer data may occur through inadequate use of security controls by customers, service providers or employees. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could cause a loss of data, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, give rise to remediation or other expenses and subject us to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations or fines. Adobe maintains insurance to cover operational risks, such as cyber risk and technology outages, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. Further, such perceived or actual unauthorized loss or disclosure of the information we collect, process or store, or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.</p>

<p>Much of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed and controlled directly by Adobe or third-party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com and our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud solutions. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third- party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us without adequate notice, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could disrupt our business operations and those of our customers, subject us to reputational harm, costly and time-intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future business. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems and services or to run our business. In addition, supply chain disruptions stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war may harm our customers and suppliers and further complicate existing supply chain constraints. Occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. If a transition among data centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers and result in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results, reputation and our business.</p>
<p>It is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with applicable notification requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition, the loss of data resulting from computer viruses, worms, ransomware or other malware may harm our systems could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and time-intensive notification requirements.</p>
<p>We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time due to factors such as significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software (or that of a third-party service provider). If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages or performance issues could occur, which would impact our customers. Such a strain on our infrastructure</p>
<p>capacity could subject us to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments or financial liabilities and result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business. If we supply materially inaccurate information or experience significant interruptions in our systems, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers and we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.</p>
<h3 id="security-vulnerabilities-in-our-products-and-systems-or-in-our-supply-chain-could-lead-to-reduced-revenue-or-to-liability-claims.">Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain, could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.</h3>
<p>Maintaining the security of our products and services is a critical issue for us and our customers. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against them. Certain unauthorized parties have in the past managed, and may again in the future manage, to gain access to and misuse some of our systems and software, or that of our third-party service providers, in order to access the authentication, payment and personal information of our end users and employees. In addition, cyber-attackers (which may include individuals or groups, as well as sophisticated groups with significant resources, such as nation-state and state- sponsored attackers) also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, services, information systems or networks. The frequency and sophistication of such threats continues to increase and often becomes further heightened in connection with geopolitical tensions. Hardware, software and operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties have contained and may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer’s ability to operate or use our products. Like other global companies, we face an increasingly difficult challenge to attract and retain highly qualified security personnel to assist us in combating these security threats. The costs to prevent, eliminate, mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems, including notifying affected parties, may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.</p>
<p>Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. This existing risk is compounded given the current hybrid model work environment, where a large portion of our workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. These actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us, our employees, our customers or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation and liability or fines, costly and time-intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, thereby requiring time and resources to mitigate these impacts. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services and store and process more data.</p>
<p>These issues affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. From time to time we have identified, and in the future we may identify other, vulnerabilities in some of our applications and services and those of our third-party service providers. In some cases, such vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets. We continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to our data, systems and networks, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business email compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions. These continued enhancements and changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, may increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in the associated security measures. Any such failure or gap could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, regularly reviewing our service providers’ security controls, reviewing and auditing our hosted services against independent security control frameworks (such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI), providing resources, such as mandatory security training, for our workforce and improving our incident response time, but security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of undertaking these efforts could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent unauthorized access into our systems and products in all circumstances. Despite our preventative efforts, there is no assurance that our security measures will provide</p>
<p>full effective protection from such events, and actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims) and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services or to reduce or delay future purchases. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security and privacy our customers require or that meet our independent security control certification requirements, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks, overly burdensome preventative security measures or failure to fully meet independent security control certification requirements could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.</p>
<h3 id="some-of-our-enterprise-offerings-have-extended-and-complex-sales-cycles-which-can-make-our-sales-cycles-unpredictable.">Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.</h3>
<p>Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform solutions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”) in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex, which also makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services;</p></li>
<li><p>the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures and the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting with such evaluations;</p></li>
<li><p>intensifying competition within the industry;</p></li>
<li><p>the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;</p></li>
<li><p>the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments; and</p></li>
<li><p>customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.</p>
<h3 id="our-business-could-be-harmed-if-we-fail-to-effectively-manage-critical-strategic-third-party-business-relationships.">Our business could be harmed if we fail to effectively manage critical strategic third-party business relationships.</h3>
<p>As our offerings expand and our customer base grows, our relationships with strategic partners become increasingly valuable. If our contractual relationships with these third parties were to terminate, or if we were unable to renew on favorable terms, our business could be harmed. This is especially the case when the third party’s offerings are integrated with our products and services, or where the third party’s offerings are difficult to substitute or replace. Alternative arrangements for such products and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable products and services or to update their technology may result in a disruption to our business operations and those of our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation.</p>
<p>We increasingly utilize third-party distribution platforms, such as Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, for the distribution of certain of our product offerings. Although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and may offer or promote products that compete with our product offerings. Adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.</p>
<h3 id="failure-of-our-third-party-customer-service-and-technical-support-providers-to-adequately-address-customers-requests-could-harm-our-business-and-adversely-affect-our-financial-results.">Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers’ requests could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.</h3>
<p>Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. We depend heavily, and expect to continue to rely heavily, on third-party customer service and technical support representatives to provide such services. This strategy presents risks to our business since we may not be able to influence the quality of support</p>
<p>as directly as if our own employees performed these activities. Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers and associated revenue.</p>
<h3 id="if-we-are-unable-to-recruit-and-retain-key-personnel-our-business-may-be-harmed-and-our-attempts-to-operate-under-a-hybrid-work-model-may-not-be-successful-and-adversely-impact-our-business.">If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful and adversely impact our business.</h3>
<p>Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management and highly-skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Our senior management has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business, and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially if we are not successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our efforts to attract, develop, integrate and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications may be compounded by intensified restrictions on travel, immigration or the availability of work visas. Competition for experienced personnel in the information technology industry is intense and has recently intensified further due to industry trends in many areas where our employees are located. Further, the increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales. A hybrid work environment may also present operational, cybersecurity and workplace culture challenges. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain our corporate culture in a hybrid work environment, our business may be harmed.</p>
<p>We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures. Nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain these employees and increase our compensation-related expenses. We may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these expected increases in costs, causing our results to suffer.</p>
<p>We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-manage-our-sales-partner-and-distribution-channels-effectively-could-result-in-a-loss-of-revenue-and-harm-our-business.">Failure to manage our sales, partner and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business.</h3>
<p>We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which are individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue in any recent period. Nonetheless, if an agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.</p>
<p>Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively. If our partner and distribution channels are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. If our distributors favor our competitors’ products or services for any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively, which would cause our results to suffer. If our OEMs through which we distribute products and services decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. Further, the financial health of our distributors and partners and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors and partners may be unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency, the inability of such distributors and partners to obtain credit to finance access to or purchases of our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.</p>
<p>We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel include more extended sales and collection cycles, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force,</p>
<p>and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives. Moreover, recent hires may not be as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes significant time for them to achieve full productivity. Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts of our direct sales do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.</p>
<h3 id="we-face-various-risks-associated-with-our-operating-as-a-multinational-corporation.">We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.</h3>
<p>As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation;</p></li>
<li><p>foreign currency fluctuations and controls;</p></li>
<li><p>international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad, such as uncertainty caused by economic sanctions, trade disputes, armed conflicts and wars;</p></li>
<li><p>tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);</p></li>
<li><p>increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;</p></li>
<li><p>changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;</p></li>
<li><p>changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;</p></li>
<li><p>failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;</p></li>
<li><p>inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;</p></li>
<li><p>delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;</p></li>
<li><p>the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;</p></li>
<li><p>costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;</p></li>
<li><p>operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and</p></li>
<li><p>other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions on business activity, which may vary significantly by region.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks, and our business may be harmed if such partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks. If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.</p>
<h2 id="risks-related-to-laws-and-regulations">Risks Related to Laws and Regulations</h2>
<h3 id="we-are-subject-to-risks-associated-with-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations-globally-which-may-harm-our-business.">We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.</h3>
<p>We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.</p>
<p>In addition, approximately 49% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.</p>

<p>As a global company, Adobe is subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our various business units and data processing activities. These laws, regulations and codes may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting Adobe’s business. Globally, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe and the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”) in China, and new and emerging state laws in the United States on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes, create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. While we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, the dynamic and evolving nature of these laws, regulations and codes, as well as their interpretation by regulators and courts, may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers’ ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction and deletion of their personal information) and to implement our business models effectively. These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Additionally, we collect and store information on behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.</p>
<p>Transferring personal information across international borders is complex and subject to legal and regulatory requirements as well as active litigation and enforcement in a number of jurisdictions around the world, each of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data as part of our business operations. For example, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated and litigated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) are the subject of regulatory interpretation and judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. We are closely monitoring for developments related to valid transfer mechanisms available for transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area (including the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework) and other countries that have similar trans-border data flow requirements and adjusting our practices accordingly. The open judicial questions and regulatory interpretations related to the validity of transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses have resulted in some changes in the obligations required to provide our services in the European Union and could expose us to potential sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries, including China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and for data localization (i.e., where personal data must remain stored in the country). If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers’ business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. We apply for patents in the United States and internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely, this could result in revenue loss, or have other adverse effects on operations and harm our business. We offer our products and services in foreign countries</p>
<p>and we may seek intellectual property protection from those foreign legal systems. Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those offered in the United States, and the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.</p>
<p>If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code. Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.</p>
<h3 id="we-may-incur-substantial-costs-defending-against-third-parties-alleging-that-we-infringe-their-proprietary-rights.">We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.</h3>
<p>We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products or services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.</p>
<h3 id="changes-in-accounting-principles-or-interpretations-thereof-could-have-a-significant-impact-on-our-financial-position-and-results-of-operations.">Changes in accounting principles or interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.</h3>
<p>We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results, could retroactively affect previously reported transactions and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.</p>
<p>Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. <em>For additional information regarding new standards that may have significant impact to our consolidated financial statements, see the section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</em></p>
<p>Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results.</p>
<h3 id="changes-in-tax-rules-and-regulations-or-interpretations-thereof-may-adversely-affect-our-effective-tax-rates.">Changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our effective tax rates.</h3>
<p>We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. Tax laws in the United States and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations are issued. The applicability and impact of changes in tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years.</p>
<p>Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union,</p>
<p>could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. These countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.</p>
<h3 id="contracting-with-government-entities-exposes-us-to-additional-risks-inherent-in-the-government-procurement-process.">Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.</h3>
<p>We provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of domestic and foreign government entities, which introduces certain risks, including extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.</p>
<h2 id="risks-related-to-financial-performance">Risks Related to Financial Performance</h2>
<h3 id="if-our-customers-fail-to-renew-subscriptions-in-accordance-with-our-expectations-our-future-revenue-and-operating-results-could-suffer-and-our-subscription-offerings-may-create-additional-risk-related-to-the-timing-of-revenue-recognition.">If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could suffer, and our subscription offerings may create additional risk related to the timing of revenue recognition.</h3>
<p>Our offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and service agreements. Since our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically ranges from 1 to 36 months, our customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Our varied customer base and flexible duration complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rates. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and competitors’ offerings, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of general economic conditions or uncertainty in financial markets, including as a result of a global health crisis and geopolitical conflict, which has affected and may continue to affect certain sectors of the economy disproportionately. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.</p>
<p>We generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter and may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.</p>
<p>Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="we-may-incur-losses-associated-with-currency-fluctuations-and-may-not-be-able-to-effectively-hedge-our-exposure.">We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.</h3>
<p>Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business. Geopolitical and economic events, including war, trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty have caused, and may in the future cause, currencies to fluctuate. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments that we believe are appropriate. Our hedging</p>
<p>activities have not and may not in the future offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.</p>
<h3 id="if-our-goodwill-or-amortizable-intangible-assets-become-impaired-then-we-could-be-required-to-record-a-significant-charge-to-earnings.">If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.</h3>
<p>GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. In addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, including declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets was determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.</p>
<h3 id="we-have-issued-4.15-billion-of-notes-in-debt-offerings-and-may-incur-other-debt-in-the-future-which-may-adversely-affect-our-financial-condition-and-future-financial-results.">We have issued $4.15 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.</h3>
<p>We have $4.15 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;</p></li>
<li><p>requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and</p></li>
<li><p>limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable.</p>
<p>In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.</p>
<h3 id="our-investment-portfolio-may-become-impaired-by-deterioration-of-the-financial-markets.">Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.</h3>
<p>Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.</p>
<p>Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, including from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of December 2, 2022, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and we can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.</p>
<h2 id="general-risk-factors">General Risk Factors</h2>
<h3 id="catastrophic-events-including-global-pandemics-such-as-the-covid-19-pandemic-may-disrupt-our-business-and-adversely-affect-our-financial-condition-and-results-of-operations.">Catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.</h3>
<p>We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. In</p>
<p>addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on how we and our customers are operating our businesses and our operating results. Our operations have also been and may in the future be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control, including the emergence and spread of more transmissible variants. The extent to which global pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impact our financial condition or results of operations will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as whether there is a material impact on the businesses or productivity of our customers, partners, employee, suppliers and other partners. To the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this report may be heightened.</p>
<h3 id="climate-change-may-have-a-long-term-impact-on-our-business.">Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.</h3>
<p>While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. Our major sites in California, Utah and India are vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, in California, increasing intensity of drought throughout the state and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities where we work and live. While this danger has a low-assessed risk of disrupting normal business operations, it has the potential impact on employees’ abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on U.S., India and other major regions’ critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers and/or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. To inform our disclosures and take potential action as appropriate, Adobe is aligned with the guidelines of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative environmental metrics. Regulatory developments, changing market dynamics and stakeholder expectations regarding climate change may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h3 id="uncertainty-about-current-and-future-economic-conditions-and-other-adverse-changes-in-general-political-conditions-in-any-of-the-major-countries-in-which-we-do-business-could-adversely-affect-our-operating-results.">Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.</h3>
<p>As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally, including trends toward protectionism and nationalism, other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, rising interest rates or a recession, and other events beyond our control, such as economic sanctions, natural disasters, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemics, political instability, armed conflicts and wars, including the Russia-Ukraine war. Worsening economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the businesses and financial health of many of our customers and hurt their creditworthiness. As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services. Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Among our customers are government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the government’s ability to purchase our products and services. Deterioration in economic conditions in</p>
<p>any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and derivative programs. Any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h3 id="revenue-margin-or-earnings-shortfalls-or-the-volatility-of-the-market-generally-may-cause-the-market-price-of-our-stock-to-decline.">Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.</h3>
<p>In the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about, our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), sales of our Digital Experience offerings or other key performance metrics;</p></li>
<li><p>changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;</p></li>
<li><p>whether our results meet analysts’ expectations;</p></li>
<li><p>compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies;</p></li>
<li><p>the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or our competitors;</p></li>
<li><p>the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers;</p></li>
<li><p>recruitment or departure of key personnel;</p></li>
<li><p>variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry;</p></li>
<li><p>general socio-economic, political or market conditions;</p></li>
<li><p>macroeconomic conditions and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and rising interest rates and global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war; and</p></li>
<li><p>unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company’s securities for a period of time may increase the company’s susceptibility to securities class action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business.</p>

Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, filed with the SEC on January 21, 2022.</em></p>
<h1 id="critical-accounting-policies-and-estimates">CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</h1>
<p>In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.</p>
<h2 id="revenue-recognition">Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.</p>
<p>Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.</p>
<h2 id="business-combinations">Business Combinations</h2>
<p>We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;</p></li>
<li><p>expected costs to develop acquired technologies and patents internally into commercially viable products;</p></li>
<li><p>historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;</p></li>
<li><p>the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;</p></li>
<li><p>the expected use of the acquired assets; and</p></li>
<li><p>discount rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin.</p>
<p>Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.</p>
<h2 id="accounting-for-income-taxes">Accounting for Income Taxes</h2>
<p>We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.</p>
<p>Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our interpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final determination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.</p>

<p>In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media reportable segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment. <em><a href="#note-3.-acquisitions">See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements f</a>or <a href="#note-3.-acquisitions">further information regarding these acquisitions.</a></em></p>
<h1 id="results-of-operations">RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h1>
<h2 id="overview-of-2022">Overview of 2022</h2>
<p>For our fiscal 2022, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, driven by the ongoing shift towards a digital-first world. As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.</p>
<p><em>Digital Media</em></p>
<p>In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences. Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and</p>
<p>syncing of files across users’ devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community- based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.</p>
<p>We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.</p>
<p>We continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.</p>
<p>We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.</p>
<p>As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (“DDOM”) and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.</p>
<p>Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:</p>

<p>In March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37 billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media ARR grew to</p>
<p>$13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2022 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 billion or approximately $712 million lower than the ARR reported above.</p>
<p>Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2022 was</p>
<p>$10.46 billion, up from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 10% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2022 was $2.38 billion, up from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 21% year-over-year growth. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $12.84 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $11.52 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 11% year- over-year growth driven by strong net new user growth.</p>
<p><em>Digital Experience</em></p>
<p>We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage are strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to integrate our comprehensive set of solutions.</p>
<p>Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the following strategic growth pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Data insights and audiences.</em> Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver robust customer profiles and AI-powered analytics across the customer journey to provide timely, relevant experiences across platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Content and commerce.</em> Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and optimize content delivery through Adobe Experience Manager, and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses with Adobe Commerce.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Customer journeys.</em> Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases, including through Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Journey Optimizer.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Marketing workflow.</em> We offer Adobe Workfront, a work management platform directed toward marketers to orchestrate campaign workflows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.</p>
<p>We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.</p>
<p>Digital Experience revenue was $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021 which represents 14% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.88 billion in fiscal 2022 from $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 15% year-over-year growth.</p>
<p><em>Macroeconomic Conditions</em></p>
<p>As a corporation with an extensive global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the Russia- Ukraine war, COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our revenue and earnings during fiscal 2022, and are expected to continue to negatively impact our financial results in fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. <em><a href="#item-1a.-risk-factors">See the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further</a> <a href="#item-1a.-risk-factors">discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business.</a></em></p>
<p><em>Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2022</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $13.97 billion as of December 2, 2022 increased by $1.82 billion, or 15%, from $12.15 billion as of December 3, 2021. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, partially offset by an $87 million ARR reduction taken in March 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war.</p></li>
<li><p>Creative revenue of $10.46 billion increased by $913 million, or 10%, during fiscal 2022, from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021. Document Cloud revenue of $2.38 billion increased by $409 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2022, from</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$1.97 billion in fiscal 2021. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digital Experience revenue of $4.42 billion increased by $555 million, or 14%, during fiscal 2022, from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.</p></li>
<li><p>Remaining performance obligations of $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022 increased by $1.20 billion, or 9%, from $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost of revenue of $2.17 billion increased by $300 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2022, from $1.87 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, as well as increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Operating expenses of $9.34 billion increased by $1.23 billion, or 15%, during fiscal 2022, from $8.12 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion during fiscal 2022 increased by $608 million, or 8%, from $7.23 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher net income after adjustment for non-cash items.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
<p>Revenue for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.</p>

<p><em>Product</em></p>
<p>Our product revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to licenses for on-premise software purchased on a perpetual basis, for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. We primarily recognize product revenue at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.</p>
<p><em>Services and Other</em></p>
<p>Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and- materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.</p>

<p>Revenue from Digital Media increased $1.32 billion during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, driven by increases in revenue associated with our Creative and Document Cloud subscription offerings due to continued demand amid an increasingly digital environment and strong customer acquisition and engagement, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p><em>Digital Experience</em></p>
<p>Revenue from Digital Experience increased $555 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to net new additions across our subscription offerings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.</p>

<p>Overall revenue during fiscal 2022 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in Digital Media revenue and, to a lesser extent, increases in Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.</p>
<p>Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 were impacts associated with foreign currency which were mitigated in part by our foreign currency hedging program. During fiscal 2022, the U.S. Dollar primarily strengthened against EMEA and APAC foreign currencies as compared to fiscal 2021, which decreased revenue in</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar equivalents by approximately $486 million. During fiscal 2022, the foreign currency impacts to revenue were offset in part by net hedging gains from our cash flow hedging program of $176 million.</p>

<p>Our effective tax rate increased by approximately six percentage points during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was the same as the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the</p>
<p>U.S. federal research tax credit, largely offset by state taxes.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.</p>
<p>We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $402 million as of December 2, 2022, primarily related to certain state credits.</p>
<p>We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. The current U.S. tax law subjects the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to U.S. tax and generally allows an exemption from taxation for distributions from foreign subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In the current global tax policy environment, the domestic and foreign governing bodies continue to consider, and in some cases introduce, changes in regulations applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. As regulations are issued, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment.</p>
<p><em><a href="#note-10.-income-taxes">See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our provisi</a>on for <a href="#note-10.-income-taxes">(benefit from) income taxes.</a></em></p>
<p><em>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes</em></p>
<p>The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $321 million, $289 million and</p>
<p>$201 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.</p>
<p>The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Our future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. These countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.</p>

Other sources of cash include proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.</p>
<p><em>Cash Flows from Operating Activities</em></p>
<p>For fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.84 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in deferred revenue driven by Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, partially offset by increases in trade receivables attributable to the timing of billings.</p>
<p><em>Cash Flows from Investing Activities</em></p>
<p>For fiscal 2022, net cash used for investing activities of $570 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures and business acquisitions. <em><a href="#note-3.-acquisitions">See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regar</a>ding <a href="#note-3.-acquisitions">these acquisitions.</a></em></p>

<p>For fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $6.83 billion was primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, offset in part by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock mainly for our employee stock purchase plan. <em>See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” below.</em></p>
<h2 id="liquidity-and-capital-resources-considerations">Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations</h2>
<p>Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2023 due to changes in our planned cash outlay.</p>
<p>Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks detailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.</p>
<p>Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits, U.S. agency</p>
<p>securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.</p>
<p>We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.</p>
<p>On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. (“Figma”) for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma’s Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. We expect to finance the cash portion of the consideration using cash on hand and short-term debt instruments. While the transaction is pending, at a minimum we expect to maintain share repurchases sufficient to offset the dilution of equity issuances to our employees.</p>
<p><em>Revolving Credit Agreement</em></p>
<p>During 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for a five-year $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility through June 30, 2027, which replaces our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of October 17, 2018. Subject to the agreement of lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. As of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1.5 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.</p>
<p>Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><em>Senior Notes</em></p>
<p>We have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and our maximum commitment for interest payments was $416 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi- annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. <em><a href="#note-17.-debt">See Note 17 of our</a> <a href="#note-17.-debt">Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our debt.</a></em></p>
<p>During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the related discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.</p>
<p><em>Contractual Obligations</em></p>
<p>Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of December 2, 2022, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $6.09 billion, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services. <em><a href="#note-16.-commitments-and-contingencies">See Note 16 of our Notes</a> to <a href="#note-16.-commitments-and-contingencies">Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations.</a></em></p>
<p>We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032. As of December 2, 2022, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $548 million. <em><a href="#note-18.-leases">See Note 18</a> <a href="#note-18.-leases">of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our lease obligations.</a></em></p>
<p><em>Other</em></p>
<p>Our transition tax liability related to historical undistributed foreign earnings, which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, was approximately $313 million as of December 2, 2022 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes. In addition, the U.S. Tax Act requires companies to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures starting fiscal 2023. If not modified, we anticipate an adverse impact to our effective rates for income taxes paid, which will be partially offset by the increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, for fiscal 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act enacted on August 16, 2022 introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions to our results of operations and cash flows.</p>
<h2 id="stock-repurchase-program">Stock Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, as well as</p>
<p>5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55 through an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion. As of December 2, 2022, $583 million of prepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase agreement.</p>
<p>Subsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of</p>
<p>$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. Upon completion of the $1.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under our December 2020 authority.</p>

<h2 id="indemnifications">Indemnifications</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.</p>

<h2 id="foreign-currency-risk">Foreign Currency Risk</h2>
<p><em>Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments</em></p>
<p>In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.</p>
<p>Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:</p>

<p>As of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, were $3.25 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in Indian Rupees,</p>
<p>$480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 2, 2022, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through November 2023. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.</p>
<p>A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2022. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.</p>
<p>As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.</p>
<p>We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p><em>Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses</em></p>
<p>We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.</p>
<p>We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or</p>
<p>operating expenses, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2022, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue or operating expenses relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.</p>
<p><em>Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities</em></p>
<p>Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At December 2, 2022, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.</p>

<h2 id="interest-rate-risk">Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p><em>Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities</em></p>
<p>At December 2, 2022, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.86 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a</p>
<p>$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.</p>
<p><em>Senior Notes</em></p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the total carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $3.88 billion.</p>

<p><span id="_bookmark19" class="anchor"><span id="_bookmark20" class="anchor"></span></span><strong>NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</strong></p>
<p><em>Operations</em></p>
<p>Founded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats.</p>
<p>We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com.</a> We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud- based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).</p>
<p><em>Basis of Presentation</em></p>
<p>The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).</p>
<p><em>Use of Estimates</em></p>
<p>In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income taxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.</p>
<p><em>Fiscal Year</em></p>
<p>Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.</p>
<p><em>Reclassifications</em></p>
<p>Certain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<h2 id="significant-accounting-policies">Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<p><em>Revenue Recognition</em></p>
<p>Our revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.</p>
<p>Revenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-2">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud- enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.</p>
<p><em>Subscription, Product and Services Offerings</em></p>
<p>We enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase other Adobe products or services.</p>
<p>Fully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.</p>
<p>We recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.</p>
<p>When cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud- enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.</p>
<p>The subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably over their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.</p>
<p>Licenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as product revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenue from on-premise term license or term licensing arrangements with unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.</p>
<p>Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and- materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient.</p>
<p><em>Judgments</em></p>
<p>Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-3">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-1">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.</p>
<p>Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.</p>
<p>Standalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.</p>
<p>Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.</p>
<p>When revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.</p>
<p>We offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as variable consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.</p>
<p><em>General Contract Provisions</em></p>
<p>We maintain revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return and other limited price adjustments. Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.</p>
<p>On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-4">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-2">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>percent of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve in excess of portfolio-level estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors.</p>
<p>Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term and consumers have a period of time to terminate certain agreements without penalty. In the event a customer cancels their contract, they are generally not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them. Contracts that include termination rights without substantive penalty are accounted for as contracts only for the committed period. Periods of time after the right of termination are accounted for as optional purchases when they do not represent material rights. For certain of our usage-based license agreements, typically in our royalty and OEM businesses, reporting may be received after the end of a fiscal period. In such instances, we estimate and accrue license revenue. We base our estimates on multiple factors, including historical sales information, seasonality and other business information which may impact our estimates. We do not estimate variable consideration for our sales and usage-based license royalty agreements, consistent with the associated exception for sales and usage-based royalties for the license of intellectual property under the revenue recognition standard.</p>
<p><em>Property and Equipment</em></p>
<p>We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years for computers and other equipment, which includes our corporate jet, 2 to 5 years for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 25 years for building improvements and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 15 years.</p>
<p><em>Leases</em></p>
<p>We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. In certain of our lease arrangements, primarily those related to our data center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For these arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement involves an identified asset that is physically distinct or whether we have the right to substantially all of the capacity of an identified asset that is not physically distinct. In arrangements that involve an identified asset, there is also judgment in evaluating if we have the right to direct the use of that asset.</p>
<p>We do not have any finance leases. Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, which approximates the interest rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in similar economic environments. As of December 2, 2022, our leases had remaining lease terms of up to 9 years, some of which included options to extend the lease for up to 14 years and options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Optional periods to extend the lease, including by not exercising a termination option, are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components, principally common area maintenance for our facilities leases, as a single lease component for our facilities and data center leases.</p>
<p>In accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance sheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</p>
<p><em>Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets</em></p>
<p>Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units on the date of acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount. In performing our goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment, which requires that we consider events or</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-5">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-3">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting unit’s net assets and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are greater than the carrying amounts, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not performed.</p>
<p>If the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should be performed, we then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.</p>
<p>We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We determined, after performing a qualitative review of each reporting unit, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed. We did not identify any events or changes in circumstances since the performance of our annual goodwill impairment test that would require us to perform another goodwill impairment test during the fiscal year.</p>
<p>We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges for all periods presented.</p>
<p>Our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 14 years. Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:</p>

<p>We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.</p>
<p>Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our interpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.</p>

<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-4">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p><em>Taxes Collected from Customers</em></p>
<p>We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements.</p>
<p>Accordingly, taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.</p>
<p><em>Treasury Stock</em></p>
<p>Prepayments made for repurchases of our common stock are classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and only shares physically delivered to us at period ends are excluded from the computation of earnings per share.</p>
<p>We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p><em>Advertising Expenses</em></p>
<p>Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1.04 billion,</p>
<p>$865 million and $592 million, respectively. Prior year amounts have been recast to conform to current year presentation, which reflect changes to modernize the categorization of costs reported as advertising expenses, primarily associated with the inclusion of certain digital advertising costs. There was no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income resulting from this change.</p>
<p><em>Foreign Currency Translation</em></p>
<p>We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).</p>
<p><em>Derivative Financial Instruments</em></p>
<p>In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses primarily in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars and Indian Rupees. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.</p>
<p>We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings.</p>
<p>Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each period as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option contracts and forward contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses and Treasury lock agreements are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or interest expense, as applicable.</p>
<p><em>Concentration of Risk</em></p>
<p>Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-7">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-5">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy. Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these investments.</p>
<p>We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.</p>
<p>Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and require letters of credit or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments from their customers. Certain contracts with advertising agencies contain sequential liability provisions, under which the agency is not required to pay until payment is received from the agency’s customers. In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit-worthiness of the agency’s customers in addition to the agency itself. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customer’s ability and intention to pay is not probable, the arrangement is not considered to be a revenue contract. Accordingly, we will not recognize any consideration received as revenue until termination or substantive completion of the services.</p>

<p><em>Segment Information</em></p>
<p>We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.</p>
<p>Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.</p>
<p>Our business is organized into the following reportable segments:</p>

<p>A receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of December 2, 2022, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $93 million. As of December 3, 2021, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $1.88 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $82 million.</p>
<p><em>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</em></p>
<p>We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables and is based on both specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective basis by considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts was</p>
<p>$23 million and $16 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Contract Assets</em></p>
<p>A contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has occurred. Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated to the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit- worthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations</em></p>
<p>Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.</p>
<p>Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non- refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to these agreements comprised approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-10">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-8">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>As of December 3, 2021, the balance of deferred revenue was $4.88 billion. Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying performance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due to revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022, approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was recognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.</p>
<p>Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint.</p>
<p>Remaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above comprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining performance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.</p>
<p><em>Contract Acquisition Costs</em></p>
<p>We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.</p>
<p>The costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also include portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer contracts and incentive payments to partners.</p>
<p>Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years. Amortization of capitalized costs are included in sales and marketing expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we amortized $238 million, $212 million and $186 million of capitalized contract acquisition costs into sales and marketing expense, respectively. We did not incur any impairment losses for all periods presented.</p>
<p>Capitalized contract acquisition costs were $629 million and $611 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, of which $406 million was long-term and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for both periods presented. The remaining balance of the capitalized costs to obtain contracts was current and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.</p>
<p><em>Refund Liabilities</em></p>
<p>We record refund liabilities for amounts that may be subject to future refunds, which include sales returns reserves and customer rebates and credits. Refund liabilities are included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refund liabilities were $106 million and $128 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Significant Customers</em></p>
<p>For all periods presented, there were no customers that represented at least 10% of net revenue or that were responsible for over 10% of our trade receivables.</p>

<p><em>Figma</em></p>
<p>On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. (“Figma”) for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma’s Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022.</p>
<p>Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.</p>
<p><em>Frame.io</em></p>
<p>On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management’s estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill.

<p>Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid marketable securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify our investments in marketable debt securities as “available-for-sale.” We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. Unrealized gains and unrealized non- credit-related losses of marketable debt securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized credit-related losses are recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding allowance for credit-related losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and recognized when realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income.</p>

<p>We review our debt securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis for impairment. For debt securities in unrealized loss positions, we determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors if we neither intend to sell nor anticipate that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We consider factors such as the extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, any noted failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, changes to the rating of the security and other relevant credit-related factors in determining whether or not a credit loss exists. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of our investments.</p>

<p>Our fixed income available-for-sale debt securities consist of high quality, investment grade securities from diverse issuers with a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We therefore categorize all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.</p>
<p>The fair values of our money market funds, time deposits and deferred compensation plan assets, which consist of money market and other mutual funds, are based on quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Our over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.</p>
<p><em>Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis</em></p>
<p>The fair value of our senior notes was $3.88 billion as of December 2, 2022, based on observable market prices in less active markets and categorized as Level 2. <a href="#note-17.-debt"><em>See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.</em></a></p>

<p><strong>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</strong></p>
<h1 id="note-6.-derivative-financial-instruments">NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</h1>
<p>We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.</p>
<p>We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p><em>Cash Flow Hedges</em></p>
<p>In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $2.43 billion and $2.06 billion, respectively, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, Indian Rupees, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.</p>
<p>In June 2019, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedged the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and were settled upon debt issuance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest expense over the term of our debt due February 1, 2030. <a href="#note-17.-debt"><em>See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.</em></a></p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, we had net derivative gains on our foreign exchange option contracts expected to be recognized within the next 18 months, of which $53 million of gains are expected to be recognized into revenue within the next 12 months. In addition, we had net derivative losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts, of which $7 million of losses are expected to be recognized into operating expenses within the next 12 months, and net derivative losses on our Treasury lock agreements, of which $5 million is expected to be recognized into interest expense within the next 12 months.</p>
<p>To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or interest expense, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the same income statement line item as the hedged item. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively, and on an ongoing basis both retrospectively and prospectively. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.</p>
<p><em>Non-Designated Hedges</em></p>
<p>Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related contracts.</p>

<p><em>Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights (“IP rights”)</em></p>
<p>During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.</p>

<p>Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $202 million and</p>
<p>$467 million, respectively. We also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $39 million and $362 million, respectively. The majority of the federal net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, and the remaining will expire in various years from fiscal 2023 through 2040. Certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and/or are reduced by a valuation allowance. The net carrying amount of such assets is expected to be fully realized.</p>
<p>In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management determined that it is more likely than not that we will not fully realize certain available tax attributes and other tax assets in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized. As of December 2, 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of $402 million primarily related to certain state credits. For fiscal 2022, the increase in the valuation allowance was $67 million.</p>
<p>As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes. As of December 2, 2022, the cumulative amount of foreign earnings considered permanently reinvested upon which taxes have not been provided, and the corresponding unrecognized deferred tax liability, was not material.</p>

<p>Ending balance <u>$ 321</u> <u>$ 289</u></p>
<p>Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties included in long-term income taxes payable related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<p>While we file federal, state and local income tax returns globally, our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with 2018 being the earliest fiscal year open for examination in all of our major tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.</p>
<p>The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.</p>
<h1 id="note-11.-benefit-plans">NOTE 11. BENEFIT PLANS</h1>
<p><em>Retirement Savings Plan</em></p>
<p>The Adobe Inc. 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, is a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the IRS annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2022, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We contributed $76 million, $64 million and $59 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We are under no obligation to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.</p>
<p><em>Deferred Compensation Plan</em></p>
<p>The Adobe Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives are able to defer a portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified compensation, including commissions, bonuses and directors’ fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan year in which election is made or, with respect to equity awards, vests. Members of the Board of Directors are also eligible to participate and are able to defer cash compensation and elect cash benefit distributions in the same manner as executives. Beginning January 1, 2020, only members of the Board are permitted to defer equity awards. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-23">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-16">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>cash in the form of a lump sum, or five, ten, or fifteen-year annual installments. For equity award elections, distributions are made in stock in the form of a lump sum payment only.</p>
<p>Certain deferred compensation is invested in money market and other mutual funds and subsequently recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with corresponding unrealized holding gains and losses recorded as investment gains (losses) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Undistributed deferred compensation is recorded as long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the invested amounts under the plan totaled $160 million and $151 million, respectively. As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, undistributed deferred compensation due to participants totaled $178 million and $174 million, respectively.</p>
<h1 id="note-12.-stock-based-compensation">NOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</h1>
<p>Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock- based compensation plans and programs:</p>
<p><em>Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Programs</em></p>
<p>We grant restricted stock units and performance share awards to eligible employees under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”). Restricted stock units generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “ECC”).</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, we had reserved 52.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2019 Plan and had 30.5 million shares available for grant.</p>
<p>Our Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding company performance and enhance our ability to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The ECC approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology.</p>
<p>In January 2022, the ECC approved the 2022 Performance Share Program. Shares outstanding under our 2022 Performance Share Program may be earned based on the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial metrics measured over three one-year performance periods. Each type of performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is determined independently of the other. Shares associated with each performance goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance targets are defined.</p>
<p>Shares outstanding under our 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period.</p>
<p>Performance share awards in each of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs will be earned and cliff-vest upon the later of (i) the three-year anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective Performance Share Program, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of achievement of the final performance period in the respective Performance Share Program, contingent upon the participant’s continued service. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of performance shares.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, the shares awarded under our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs remained outstanding and were yet to be earned.</p>
<p><em>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</em></p>
<p>Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-24">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-17">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. If the market value of our common stock at the end of a purchase period is lower than the market value at the beginning of the offering period, participants are rolled over into the subsequent offering, resulting in a reset of the offering price and the twenty- four month offering period.</p>
<p>The ESPP will continue until the earlier of termination by the Board of Directors or the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, we had reserved 103.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP and approximately 10.7 million shares remain available for future issuance.</p>
<p><em>Issuance of Shares</em></p>
<p>Upon vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares or purchase of shares under the ESPP, we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of on-going dilution from issuance of shares, we instituted a stock repurchase program. <em><a href="#note-14.-stock-repurchase-program">See Note 14 for information regarding our stoc</a>k <a href="#note-14.-stock-repurchase-program">repurchase programs.</a></em></p>
<p><em>Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation</em></p>
<p>Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.</p>
<p>Our restricted stock units are valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics are valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date.</p>
<p>We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP purchase rights. The determination of the grant date fair value of our ESPP purchase rights is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected dividends.</p>

<p>The weighted average grant date fair values of performance share awards granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $402.24, $325.24 and $271.62, respectively. The total fair value of performance share awards vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $192 million, $212 million and $273 million, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Summary of Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares</em></p>
<p>Employees purchased 0.8 million shares at an average price of $333.92, 1.0 million shares at an average price of</p>
<p>$294.15, and 1.2 million shares at an average price of $218.37 for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The intrinsic value of shares purchased during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $73 million, $256 million and $216 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value on the date of purchase and the purchase price of the shares.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2022, the rollover provision of our ESPP was triggered and resulted in incremental expense to be recognized over the new twenty-four-month offering period, which did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income.</p>
<p><em>Compensation Costs</em></p>
<p>We recognize the estimated compensation costs of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.</p>
<p>Compensation costs for our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite performance period or service period of the entire award, whichever is longer. Compensation costs for our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics are recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, based upon the expected levels of achievement, which are assessed periodically until certification by the ECC.</p>
<p>We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.</p>

<h1 id="note-14.-stock-repurchase-program">NOTE 14. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM</h1>
<p>To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted additional authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $2.4 billion. Under the terms of the ASR, the financial institution agreed to deliver a portion of shares to us at contract inception and the remaining shares at settlement, which occurred in fiscal 2022. The total number of shares delivered and average purchase price paid per share were determined upon settlement based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $4.15 billion, $3.95 billion and $3.05 billion, respectively. Under the terms of these structured stock repurchase agreements, the financial institutions agreed to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the respective contract terms, and the number of shares delivered each month was determined based</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-27">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-20">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>on the total notional amount of the contracts, the number of trading days in the intervals and the VWAP of our stock during the intervals less an agreed upon discount.</p>
<p>We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the VWAP of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is expected to be higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements, as well as 5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55 through the ASR described above. Comparatively, we repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares at an average price of $536.17 per share in fiscal 2021 and 8.0 million shares at an average price of $376.38 per share in fiscal 2020.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2022, $583 million of prepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase agreement.</p>
<p>Subsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of</p>
<p>$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. Upon completion of the $1.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under our December 2020 authority.</p>
<h1 id="note-15.-net-income-per-share">NOTE 15. NET INCOME PER SHARE</h1>
<p>Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, stock purchase rights and performance share awards using the treasury stock method. Performance share awards are included based on the number of shares that would be issued as if the end of the reporting period was the end of the performance period and the result was dilutive.</p>

<p><em>Royalties</em></p>
<p>We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Indemnifications</em></p>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.</p>
<p><em>Legal Proceedings</em></p>
<p>In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third- party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.</p>
<h1 id="adobe-inc.-29">ADOBE INC.</h1>
<h2 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-continued-21">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)</h2>
<p>In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters, and investigations, including government investigations. Some of these disputes, legal proceedings and investigations may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible or probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.</p>
<p>All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.</p>
<p>In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.</p>

<p><em>Senior Notes</em></p>
<p>In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2025. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.</p>
<p>In February 2020, we issued $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2023, $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2025, $850 million of senior notes due February 1, 2027, and $1.30 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2030. Our total proceeds of approximately $3.14 billion, net of issuance discount, were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt instruments due in fiscal 2020. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the related discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.</p>
<p>Our senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The notes do not contain financial covenants but include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.</p>
<p><em>Revolving Credit Agreement</em></p>
<p>In June 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), providing for a five-year $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement entered into in October 2018 (the “Prior Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries that may be designated from time to time as additional borrowers. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments, obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. At our election, loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at either the (i) term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus a margin, (ii) adjusted daily SOFR rate, plus a margin, (iii) alternative currency rate, plus a margin, or (iv) base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.500%, (b) the agent’s prime rate, or (c) term SOFR plus 1.00%. The margin for term SOFR, adjusted daily SOFR, and alternative currency rate loans is based on our debt ratings, and ranges from 0.460% to 0.900%. In addition, facility fees determined according to our debt ratings are payable on the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage, quarterly in an amount ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% per annum. We are permitted to permanently reduce the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, Adobe and any of its subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement.</p>
<p>The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions.</p>
<p>The facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.</p>
<p>As of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Revolving Credit Agreement.</p>
<p>In connection with and at the time that we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement originally scheduled to expire in October 2023 was terminated. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement at the time of termination. There were no penalties paid as a result of the termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement.</p>

<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended December 2, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2022, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended December 2, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2022 based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.</p>
<p><em>Basis for Opinions</em></p>
<p>The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.</p>
<p>Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.</p>
<p><em>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</em></p>
<p>A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
<p><em>Critical Audit Matter</em></p>
<p>The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.</p>
<p><em>Performance obligations in cloud-enabled software subscriptions</em></p>
<p>As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise or on-device software licenses in the Company’s Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings. Because of this, the cloud-based services and the on-premise/on-device software licenses are not considered distinct from each other and the applicable subscription is accounted for as a single performance obligation.</p>
<p>We identified the assessment of performance obligations in these cloud-enabled software subscription offerings as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the nature of the Company’s Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, their intended benefit to customers as an integrated offering, and the level of integration that exists between the cloud-enabled services and the on-premise/on-device licenses.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the assessment of distinct performance obligations. We read the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offering agreements to understand the contractual terms and conditions. We participated in product demonstrations and performed interviews with the Company’s product and engineering department to both understand and observe specific functionalities of the integrated offering and evaluate the nature of the promise made to the Company’s Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers. We evaluated the features and functionalities of the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription that can be accessed only when using the on-premise/on-device software while connected to the Adobe cloud to assess that customers receive the intended benefit from each solution only as an integrated offering.</p>

<h2 id="disclosure-controls-and-procedures">Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 2, 2022. Based on their evaluation as of December 2, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.</p>

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
