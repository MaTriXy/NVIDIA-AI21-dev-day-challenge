<p><em>Firm culture</em></p>
<p>The foundations of JPMorgan Chase’s culture are its core values and How We Do Business Principles, which are fundamental to the Firm’s success and are represented by four central corporate tenets: exceptional client service; operational excellence; a commitment to integrity, fairness and responsibility; and cultivation of a great team and winning culture. The Firm maintains its focus on its culture of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of Conduct and by increasing employee awareness, education, communication and training. An important part of these efforts includes the Firm’s Business Resource Groups, which are groups of employees who support JPMorgan Chase’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. The Firm has global Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion centers of excellence that lead the Firm’s strategy in supporting its commitments to create more equity and lasting impact in communities, and strengthen its inclusive culture.</p>
<p><em>Attracting and retaining employees</em></p>
<p>The goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external candidates and internal employees who are seeking a different role with challenging and stimulating career opportunities. These opportunities range from internship training programs for students to entry-level, management and executive careers. During 2022, approximately two- thirds of the Firm’s employment opportunities were filled by external candidates, with the remainder filled by existing employees. In addition, depending on business needs, and where appropriate, the Firm has implemented hybrid work models which include a mix of on-site and remote work for certain roles.</p>
<p>Diversity is an important area of focus throughout the Firm’s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. The Firm’s global Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion centers of excellence seek to increase representation of and advance career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and mentorship.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce. In addition, and where appropriate, the Firm’s hiring practices focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees held.</p>
<p><em>Developing employees</em></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase supports the professional development and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training curriculum is required for new hires, which covers, among other topics, compliance with the Firm’s Code of Conduct and information concerning Firm policies and standards,</p>
<p>including those relating to cybersecurity. In addition, the Firm offers extensive training programs and educational resources to all employees, covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership, change management, analytical thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, and risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm’s global leadership and management development center of excellence, is focused on creating one Firmwide leadership culture.</p>
<p><em>Compensation and benefits</em></p>
<p>The Firm provides market-competitive compensation and benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s compensation philosophy includes guiding principles that drive compensation-related decisions across the Firm, and includes: pay-for-performance practices designed to attract and retain top talent; responsiveness and alignment with shareholder interests; and reinforcement of the Firm’s culture and How We Do Business Principles, including the integration of risk, controls and conduct considerations. The Firm’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all employees includes compensation review processes that seek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are paid equitably and competitively for the work they do.</p>
<p>The Firm also supports employees’ well-being. JPMorgan Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to employees and their families, including healthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, on-site health and wellness centers, counseling and resources related to mental health, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, and financial coaching. In 2022, the Firm implemented or announced enhancements to certain health and wellness benefits for U.S. employees, including expanded medical plan coverage and paid time off policies related to parental, critical caregiving and bereavement leaves.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="supervision-and-regulation">Supervision and regulation</p>
<p>The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="financial-holding-company">Financial holding company:</p>
<p><em>Consolidated supervision</em>. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is a bank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities or licenses of those subsidiaries.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.- based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”).</p>
<p>JPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated by the European Central Bank (“ECB”) as well as the local regulators in each of the countries in which it operates. The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities, as applicable, in the countries in which they operate.</p>
<p><em>Permissible business activities</em>. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other than</p>
<p>those permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company engaged in such activities.</p>
<p><em>Capital and liquidity requirements</em>. The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the international Basel III capital and liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity requirements.</p>
<p>Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S.</p>
<p>Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104.</p>
<p><em>Stress tests</em>. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2023. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2023 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The Firm’s final SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 2023. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.</p>
<p><em>Enhanced prudential standards</em>. As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the</p>
<p>U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk</p>
<p>management standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities.</p>
<p><em>Resolution and recovery</em>. The Firm is required to maintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually, summarizing the actions it would take to remain well- capitalized and well-funded in order to avoid failure in the case of an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of material distress or failure (a “resolution plan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the regulations governing resolution plan requirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the Firm’s resolution plan submissions will alternate between “targeted” and “full” plans. The Firm’s “targeted” resolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021, and the Firm's next "full" resolution plan is due to be filed on or before July 1, 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and submit a separate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC on or before December 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local resolution and recovery planning requirements.</p>
<p><em>Orderly liquidation authority</em>. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly liquidation authority.” The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.</p>
<p><em>Holding company as a source of strength.</em> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p><em>Regulation of acquisitions</em>. Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to requirements, limitations and prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must</p>
<p>provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader range of activities (including acquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible acquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements.</p>
<p><em>Ongoing obligations</em>. The Firm is subject to obligations under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the Department of Justice on September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations as well as under a related order issued by the CFTC.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="subsidiary-banks">Subsidiary banks:</p>
<p>The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank.</p>
<p><em>FDIC deposit insurance.</em> The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.</p>
<p><em>FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency.</em> Upon any insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s creditors.</p>
<p><em>Prompt corrective action.</em> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.</p>
<p><em>OCC Heightened Standards.</em> The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s risk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. The bank’s board or risk</p>
<p>committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.</p>
<p><em>Restrictions on transactions with affiliates.</em> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements.</p>
<p><em>Dividend restrictions.</em> Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2023, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank.</p>
<p><em>Depositor preference.</em> Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depositary institution (“IDI”) for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-</p>
<p>U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.</p>
<p><em>Consumer supervision and regulation.</em> JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In February 2023, the CFPB proposed a rule that would significantly reduce and limit the late payment fees that credit card issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to charge to customers. The Firm’s consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency of each state.</p>
<p>In the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides retail investment management services through Nutmeg Saving</p>
<p>and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of financial services in the U.K., including obligations relating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="securities-and-broker-dealer-regulation">Securities and broker-dealer regulation:</p>
<p>The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc.

Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96 for information concerning the capital of</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="investment-management-regulation">Investment management regulation:</p>
<p>The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered investment advisers in the United States are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state and federal law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities are subject to supervision by the OCC.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="derivatives-regulation">Derivatives regulation:</p>
<p>The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers”. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC as “security-based swap dealers”. As a result, these entities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding</p>
<p>segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar requirements have also been established under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="data-privacy-and-cybersecurity-regulation">Data, privacy and cybersecurity regulation:</p>
<p>The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations globally concerning data, including data protection, consumer protection, privacy, cybersecurity and related matters. These laws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or government bodies, and will continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and operations.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="the-bank-secrecy-act-and-economic-sanctions">The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:</p>
<p>The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record- keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and EU and U.K. authorities which target entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in activities including terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations. The Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other jurisdictions in which it operates, including those that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying with certain laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="anti-corruption">Anti-Corruption:</p>
<p>The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the</p>
<p>U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="compensation-practices"><br />
Compensation practices:</p>
<p>The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies including under CRD V which in certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation policies. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Other significant international regulatory initiatives:</strong> Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a program of regulatory enhancements relating to financial services, several key elements of which are discussed below.</p>
<p>MiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on specified trading venues. MiFID II also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission (“EC”) published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related to transparency and market structure, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to increase transparency into trading across the EU by providing a centralized source of market data. This legislation remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.</p>
<p>In the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the “Wholesale Markets Review”, a set of proposals designed to streamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary markets following the U.K.’s departure from the EU. Some of the changes, such as the removal of the requirement to execute trades in shares on certain trading venues, have been introduced through the Financial Services and Markets Bill (“FSMB”), which is expected to be passed by the U.K. Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as amendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency, will be subject to further consultation, which is expected during 2023.</p>
<p>In December 2022, the EC published a legislative proposal to amend EMIR to increase the competitiveness of the EU central clearing framework and to enhance supervision of EU central counterparties (“CCPs”). These proposals are subject to further review by the European Parliament and European Council.</p>
<p>The EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”) which will impose requirements relating to sourcing of securities in the event of a settlement fail. In June 2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment to postpone the application of these rules until November 2025. The amendment remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.</p>
<p>In December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extensive package of reforms to U.K. financial services regulation known as the “Edinburgh Reforms”. These reforms aim to drive growth and competitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector following the U.K.’s departure from the EU. The reform package includes initiatives relating to a number of areas of financial services policy, including retail banks, payments, markets, digital assets and sustainable finance. The U.K. Government and regulators are expected to release further consultations and announcements related to these reforms in 2023.</p>
<p>EU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules implementing the Basel III framework during 2023. The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III final rules by January 2025, allowing for certain transitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032, respectively. The main changes implemented by the Basel III final rules will be revisions to the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to reduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling approaches and introduce internationally-agreed changes to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III final rules also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors overseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities to systematically identify, disclose and manage environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) risks as part of their risk management practices. In addition, in December 2022, the European Banking Authority (“EBA”) announced that it will publish rules and technical standards between 2023 and 2025 related to sustainable finance, which will be applicable to EU banks. The Firm’s banking entities in the</p>
<p>U.K. will be required to comply with regulatory policies and standards related to climate risk being developed by the PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking (“IPU”) located in the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with “home country” bank separation rules or impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the EU’s IPU requirements by December 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also subject to supervisory expectations published by the ECB</p>
<p>and the PRA, respectively, for management of financial risks arising from climate change and the increasing operational reliance on IT systems, third-party services and innovative technologies, as well as supervisory expectations for operational resilience and resilience from macro- financial and geopolitical shocks. These expectations address bank strategy, governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure.</p>
<p>Policymakers in the EU have continued to implement sustainability-related initiatives. In December 2022, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The CSRD will replace and significantly expand the scope and content of ESG reporting requirements under the EU’s existing ESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will be phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC published its legislative proposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) in February 2022. The draft directive sets mandatory due diligence obligations for companies to address actual and potential human rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming from their own operations and business relationships, including the activities of companies with which they have established business relationships. The proposed legislation may also require the adoption of company-specific climate- related transition plans. The CSDDD is currently subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the Firm’s EU entities as well as to certain non-EU entities.</p>

<p><em>The above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below.</em></p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="regulatory">Regulatory</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business, and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to extensive regulation and supervision.</p>
<p>The regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly affects the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations, and JPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
<p>In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>limit the products and services that it offers</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities</p></li>
<li><p>refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue</p></li>
<li><p>pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations</p></li>
<li><p>incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers</p></li>
<li><p>dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous</p></li>
<li><p>impose restrictions on certain business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory and governmental enforcement actions</p></li>
<li><p>the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions</p></li>
<li><p>increased exposure to litigation, or</p></li>
<li><p>harm to its reputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="differences-and-inconsistencies-in-financial-services-regulation-can-negatively-impact-jpmorgan-chases-businesses-operations-and-financial-results.">Differences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, operations and financial results.</p>
<p>The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny</p></li>
<li><p>financial technology companies and other non- traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or</p></li>
<li><p>the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.</p>
<p>There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For</p>
<p>example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries</p></li>
<li><p>requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries</p></li>
<li><p>to implement processes within locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory requirements</p></li>
<li><p>the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities</p></li>
<li><p>the resolution of financial institutions</p></li>
<li><p>requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)</p></li>
<li><p>position limits and reporting rules for derivatives</p></li>
<li><p>governance and accountability regimes</p></li>
<li><p>conduct of business and control requirements, and</p></li>
<li><p>restrictions on compensation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>divest assets or restructure its operations</p></li>
<li><p>absorb increased capital and liquidity costs</p></li>
<li><p>incur higher operational and compliance costs</p></li>
<li><p>change the prices that it charges for its products and services</p></li>
<li><p>curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients</p></li>
<li><p>curtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued</p></li>
<li><p>become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or</p></li>
<li><p>incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="resolving-regulatory-investigations-can-subject-jpmorgan-chase-to-significant-penalties-and-collateral-consequences-and-could-result-in-higher-compliance-costs-or-restrictions-on-its-operations.">Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions.</p>
<p>In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>greater exposure in litigation</p></li>
<li><p>damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation</p></li>
<li><p>disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or</p></li>
<li><p>other direct and indirect adverse effects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>loss of clients, customers and business</p></li>
<li><p>restrictions on offering certain products or services, and</p></li>
<li><p>losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase expects that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions</p></li>
<li><p>governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and</p></li>
<li><p>governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions</p></li>
<li><p>pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or</p></li>
<li><p>accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-operations-and-financial-results-can-be-negatively-impacted-in-countries-with-less-predictable-legal-and-regulatory-frameworks.">JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions</p></li>
<li><p>conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations</p></li>
<li><p>uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations</p></li>
<li><p>difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive</p></li>
<li><p>the threat of regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal principles in other parts of the world, and</p></li>
<li><p>the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in any country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.</p>
<p>There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="requirements-for-the-orderly-resolution-of-jpmorgan-chase-could-result-in-jpmorgan-chase-having-to-restructure-or-reorganize-its-businesses-and-could-increase-its-funding-or-operational-costs-or-curtail-its-businesses.">Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.</p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="holders-of-jpmorgan-chase-co.s-debt-and-equity-securities-will-absorb-losses-if-it-were-to-enter-into-a-resolution.">Holders of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-</p>
<p>absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the</p></li>
</ul>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent</p>
<p>Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.</p>
<p>The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.</p>
<p>If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="political"><br />
Political</p>
<p><strong>Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.</strong></p>
<p>Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions</p></li>
<li><p>fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending</p></li>
<li><p>actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken</p></li>
<li><p>governmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk, or more generally, the impact of business activities on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, and the management of climate and ESG-related risks</p></li>
<li><p>isolationist foreign policies</p></li>
<li><p>an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities</p></li>
<li><p>economic or financial sanctions</p></li>
<li><p>the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or</p></li>
<li><p>other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency</p></li>
<li><p>provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations</p></li>
<li><p>lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”)</p></li>
<li><p>increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time</p></li>
<li><p>result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries</p></li>
<li><p>increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole</p></li>
<li><p>adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or</p></li>
<li><p>cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These factors could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession</p></li>
<li><p>greater market volatility</p></li>
<li><p>a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads</p></li>
<li><p>erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets</p></li>
<li><p>diminished investor and consumer confidence</p></li>
<li><p>lower investment growth</p></li>
<li><p>large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries</p></li>
<li><p>reduced commercial activity among trading partners</p></li>
<li><p>the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country</p></li>
<li><p>the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty</p></li>
<li><p>potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or</p></li>
<li><p>other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to higher net charge offs, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations may also be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by national, state or local governmental authorities that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>seek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies engaged in certain industries, or conversely, to penalize financial institutions that elect not to do business with such companies, or</p></li>
<li><p>mandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction</p></li>
<li><p>the threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and</p></li>
<li><p>harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from politicians, activists and other stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability to transact with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align with particular political viewpoints.</p>
<p>Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or association with certain social and environmental industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="market">Market</p>
<p><strong>Economic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>investor, consumer and business sentiment</p></li>
<li><p>events that reduce confidence in the financial markets</p></li>
<li><p>inflation, deflation or recession</p></li>

<li><p>the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit</p></li>

<li><p>the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control, and</p></li>
<li><p>the strength of the U.S. and global economies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.</p>
<p>In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>severe declines in asset values</p></li>
<li><p>unexpected credit events</p></li>
<li><p>unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)</p></li>
<li><p>the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or</p></li>
<li><p>other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-consumer-businesses-can-be-negatively-affected-by-adverse-economic-conditions-and-governmental-policies.">JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>personal and household income distribution</p></li>
<li><p>unemployment or underemployment</p></li>
<li><p>prolonged periods of exceptionally low or high interest rates</p></li>
<li><p>housing prices</p></li>
<li><p>the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services</p></li>
<li><p>consumer and small business confidence levels, and</p></li>
<li><p>changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses.</p>
<p>Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding</p>
<p>student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and</p></li>
<li><p>policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="unfavorable-market-and-economic-conditions-can-have-an-adverse-effect-on-jpmorgan-chases-wholesale-businesses.">Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.</p>
<p>In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or</p></li>
<li><p>dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.</p>
<p>The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or</p>
<p>holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.</p>
<p>An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="changes-in-interest-rates-and-credit-spreads-can-adversely-affect-jpmorgan-chases-earnings-its-liquidity-or-its-capital-levels.">Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels.</p>
<p>When interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans</p></li>
<li><p>losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client- specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients</p></li>
<li><p>the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior</p></li>
<li><p>losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities portfolio</p></li>
<li><p>lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated</p></li>
</ul>
<p>and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings</p>
<ul>
<li><p>less liquidity in the financial markets, and</p></li>
<li><p>higher funding costs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher- yielding instruments</p></li>
<li><p>unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy, and</p></li>
<li><p>a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-results-may-be-materially-affected-by-market-fluctuations-and-significant-changes-in-the-value-of-financial-instruments.">JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.</p>
<p>The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their</p>
<p>current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="credit">Credit</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the</p>
<p>U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors.</p>
<p>A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.</p>
<p>As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and</p>
<p>litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.</p>
<p>Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.</p>
<p>Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.</p>
<p>The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations, can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets, including in circumstances where coordinated action by multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or disruption. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-may-suffer-losses-if-the-value-of-collateral-declines-in-stressed-market-conditions.">JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.</p>
<p>During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds</p></li>
<li><p>collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or</p></li>
<li><p>counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant</p>
<p>market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-could-incur-significant-losses-arising-from-concentrations-of-credit-and-market-risk.">JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries</p></li>
<li><p>do business in the same geographic region, or</p></li>
<li><p>have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators.</p>
<p>Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less- creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the</p>
<p>U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.</p>
<p>If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="liquidity">Liquidity</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>market-wide illiquidity or disruption</p></li>
<li><p>unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations</p></li>
<li><p>inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices</p></li>
<li><p>default by a CCP or other significant market participant</p></li>
<li><p>unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral</p></li>
<li><p>unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and</p></li>
<li><p>lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements</p></li>
<li><p>address obligations under its resolution plan, or</p></li>
<li><p>satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-co.-is-a-holding-company-and-depends-on-the-cash-flows-of-its-subsidiaries-to-make-payments-on-its-outstanding-securities.">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company.</p>
<p>The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).</p>
<p>The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also</p>
<p>limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors.</p>
<p>As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>pay interest on its debt securities</p></li>
<li><p>pay dividends on its equity securities</p></li>
<li><p>redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and</p></li>
<li><p>fulfill its other payment obligations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="reductions-in-jpmorgan-chases-credit-ratings-may-adversely-affect-its-liquidity-and-cost-of-funding.">Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry- specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>expected future profitability</p></li>
<li><p>risk management practices</p></li>
<li><p>legal expenses</p></li>
<li><p>ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory developments</p></li>
<li><p>assumptions about government support, and</p></li>
<li><p>economic and geopolitical developments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the</p>
<p>future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.</p>
<p>A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reducing its access to capital markets</p></li>
<li><p>materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities</p></li>
<li><p>triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and</p></li>
<li><p>decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="the-transition-to-alternative-reference-rates-could-expose-jpmorgan-chase-to-operational-risks-or-litigation-and-other-disputes.">The transition to alternative reference rates could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational risks or litigation and other disputes.</p>
<p>Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain interest rate indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks”, and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants. However, there is no assurance that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace</p></li>
<li><p>arrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective, or</p></li>
<li><p>a particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants, or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are still linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) benchmark, and significant progress has been made by regulators, industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if market participants have not implemented effective operational and other arrangements to address the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments</p></li>
<li><p>failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest</p></li>
<li><p>made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates</p></li>
<li><p>engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or</p></li>
<li><p>disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="capital">Capital</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically</p>
<p>Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations</p></li>
<li><p>actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in response to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge</p></li>
<li><p>changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet or developments that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and</p></li>
<li><p>increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s SCB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase</p></li>
<li><p>requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy</p></li>
<li><p>constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or</p></li>
<li><p>curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="operational">Operational</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective</p>
<p>functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and</p></li>
<li><p>the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adherence to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties, including its custodians, vendors (such as those that provide data and cloud computing services, and security and technology services) and other market participants (such as clearing and payment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges).</p>
<p>The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>delays or other disruptions in providing services, liquidity or information to clients and customers</p></li>
<li><p>the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required</p></li>
<li><p>failure to timely settle or confirm transactions</p></li>
<li><p>the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences</p></li>
<li><p>financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers</p></li>
<li><p>higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable</p></li>
<li><p>client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services</p></li>
<li><p>limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect data as required in connection with regulatory or other investigations</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase</p></li>
<li><p>loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or</p></li>
<li><p>harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty</p></li>
<li><p>errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption</p></li>
<li><p>isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues</p></li>
<li><p>failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and</p></li>
<li><p>third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of newly- acquired businesses or of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="a-successful-cyber-attack-affecting-jpmorgan-chase-could-cause-significant-harm-to-jpmorgan-chase-and-its-clients-and-customers.">A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees</p></li>
<li><p>manipulate data</p></li>
<li><p>destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable</p></li>
<li><p>disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems</p></li>
<li><p>steal money, or</p></li>
<li><p>extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase has also experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>significant distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt online banking services and other business activities, and</p></li>
<li><p>a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.</p>
<p>A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched</p></li>
<li><p>cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally</p></li>
<li><p>JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and</p></li>
<li><p>it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services</p></li>
<li><p>the acquisition and integration of new businesses, and</p></li>
<li><p>the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from- home arrangements for employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or</p>
<p>communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.</p>
<p>A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems</p></li>
<li><p>misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators</p></li>
<li><p>disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems and those of its clients, customers and counterparties</p></li>
<li><p>the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions</p></li>
<li><p>violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws</p></li>
<li><p>financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees</p></li>
<li><p>loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures</p></li>
<li><p>dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties</p></li>
<li><p>significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and</p></li>
<li><p>harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-can-be-negatively-affected-if-it-fails-to-identify-and-address-operational-risks-associated-with-the-introduction-of-or-changes-to-products-services-and-delivery-platforms.">JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.</p>
<p>When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers</p></li>
<li><p>increased operating expenses</p></li>
<li><p>higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions</p></li>
<li><p>damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation</p></li>
<li><p>impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory intervention, or</p></li>
<li><p>weaker competitive standing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-operational-costs-and-customer-satisfaction-could-be-adversely-affected-by-the-failure-of-an-external-operational-system.">JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.</p>
<p>External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.</p>
<p>If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could</p>
<p>result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems</p></li>
<li><p>losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations</p></li>
<li><p>increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and</p></li>
<li><p>reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-business-and-operations-rely-on-its-ability-and-the-ability-of-key-external-parties-to-maintain-appropriately-staffed-workforces-and-on-the-competence-trustworthiness-health-and-safety-of-employees.">JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the ineffective implementation of business decisions</p></li>
<li><p>any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls</p></li>
<li><p>staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets</p></li>
<li><p>the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in- place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics</p></li>
<li><p>a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or</p></li>
<li><p>other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses or operations depend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-faces-substantial-legal-and-operational-risks-in-the-processing-and-safeguarding-of-personal-information.">JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal information.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals.</p>
<p>Governmental authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in fines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations.</p>
<p>Implementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs</p></li>
<li><p>hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers</p></li>
<li><p>demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and</p></li>
<li><p>require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or</p></li>
<li><p>intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.</p>
<p>In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers.</p>
<p>Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-operations-results-and-reputation-could-be-harmed-by-occurrences-of-extraordinary-events-beyond-its-control.">JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material instances of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>cyber attacks</p></li>
<li><p>security breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety</p></li>
<li><p>power, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit</p></li>
<li><p>failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data</p></li>
<li><p>damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase</p></li>
<li><p>effects of climate change</p></li>
<li><p>natural disasters or severe weather conditions</p></li>
<li><p>accidents such as explosions or structural failures</p></li>
<li><p>health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or</p></li>
<li><p>events arising from local or larger-scale civil or political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or terrorist acts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated.</p>
<p>Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting.</p>
<p>Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties</p></li>
<li><p>require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event</p></li>
<li><p>cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries</p></li>
<li><p>disrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely</p></li>

<p>JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>potential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions</p></li>

<p>Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of Directors</p></li>
<li><p>lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase</p></li>

<li><p>harm its reputation, or</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or untimely risk reporting.</p>
<p>Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously- correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-could-recognize-unexpected-losses-its-capital-levels-could-be-reduced-and-it-could-face-greater-regulatory-scrutiny-if-its-models-estimations-or-judgments-including-those-used-in-its-financial-statements-prove-to-be-inadequate-or-incorrect.">JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).</p>
<p>These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically</p>
<p>reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices</p></li>
<li><p>inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes</p></li>
<li><p>historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity</p></li>
<li><p>sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments</p></li>
<li><p>technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology</p></li>
<li><p>models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and</p></li>
<li><p>review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment.</p>
<p>Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as JPMorgan Chase experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>Some of the models and other analytical and judgment- based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing</p>
<p>risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="lapses-in-controls-over-disclosure-or-financial-reporting-could-materially-affect-jpmorgan-chases-profitability-or-reputation.">Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.</p>
<p>There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition</p></li>
<li><p>restrict its ability to access the capital markets</p></li>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="strategic">Strategic</p>
<p><strong>If JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers</p></li>
<li><p>the geographies in which it operates</p></li>
<li><p>the types of clients and customers that it serves</p></li>
<li><p>the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests</p></li>
<li><p>the counterparties with which it does business, and</p></li>
<li><p>the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers,</p>
<p>investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>devise effective business plans and strategies</p></li>
<li><p>offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers</p></li>
<li><p>allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment</p></li>
<li><p>allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations</p></li>
<li><p>conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective business acquisitions or investments, or effectively integrate newly-acquired businesses</p></li>
<li><p>appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to ESG matters</p></li>
<li><p>react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or</p></li>
<li><p>develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations in a given period.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-faces-significant-and-increasing-competition-in-the-rapidly-evolving-financial-services-industry.">JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>other banks and financial institutions</p></li>
<li><p>trading, advisory and investment management firms</p></li>
<li><p>finance companies</p></li>
<li><p>technology companies, and</p></li>
<li><p>other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. For example, aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by nonbank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants, including JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non- depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic- based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.</p>
<p>Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also</p>
<p>may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="the-effects-of-climate-change-could-adversely-affect-jpmorgan-chases-business-and-operations-both-directly-and-as-a-result-of-impacts-on-its-clients-and-customers.">The effects of climate change could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and customers.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its business, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.</p>
<p>Climate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property</p></li>
<li><p>reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase</p></li>
<li><p>interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and</p></li>
<li><p>population migration or unemployment in affected regions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Transition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lower- carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.</p>
<p>Potential adverse impacts of transition risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)</p></li>
<li><p>increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy</p></li>
<li><p>increased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as higher taxation and accelerated decarbonization policies</p></li>
<li><p>negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and</p></li>
<li><p>damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including due to any perception that its business practices are</p></li>
</ul>
<p>contrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders.</p>
<p>Climate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulation is implemented in the many regions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="conduct">Conduct</p>
<p><strong>Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance</p>
<p>management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants, employees or others. Some examples of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services</p></li>
<li><p>engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading</p></li>
<li><p>engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs</p></li>
<li><p>facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the</p></li>
</ul>
<p>proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction</p>
<ul>
<li><p>failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers</p></li>
<li><p>violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants</p></li>
<li><p>using electronic communications channels that have not been approved by JPMorgan Chase</p></li>
<li><p>engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace</p></li>
<li><p>managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and</p></li>
<li><p>misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>financial losses</p></li>
<li><p>increased operational and compliance costs</p></li>
<li><p>greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities</p></li>
<li><p>the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management</p></li>
<li><p>loss of clients or customers, and</p></li>
<li><p>harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="reputation">Reputation</p>
<p><strong>Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.</strong></p>
<p>Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s</p>
<p>business and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace</p></li>
<li><p>security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks</p></li>
<li><p>failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information</p></li>
<li><p>failure to manage risks associated with its business activities or those of its clients, including those that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies</p></li>
<li><p>failure to meet publicly-announced commitments to support ESG initiatives</p></li>
<li><p>non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations</p></li>
<li><p>operational failures</p></li>
<li><p>litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions</p></li>
<li><p>actions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency, spread of infectious disease, epidemic or pandemic</p></li>
<li><p>regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and</p></li>
<li><p>failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties, including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.</p>
<p>Social and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or</p></li>
<li><p>whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Activists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties, and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders.</p>
<p>These and other types of activist criticism and actions directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses ESG concerns in its business activities. In all of these cases, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies</p></li>
<li><p>cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase</p></li>
<li><p>impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers</p></li>
<li><p>diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees</p></li>
<li><p>prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers</p></li>
<li><p>cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or</p></li>
<li><p>a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="failure-to-effectively-manage-potential-conflicts-of-interest-or-to-satisfy-fiduciary-obligations-can-result-in-litigation-and-enforcement-actions-as-well-as-damage-jpmorgan-chases-reputation.">Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction</p></li>
<li><p>identify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase</p></li>
<li><p>deliver appropriate standards of service and quality</p></li>
<li><p>treat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care</p></li>
<li><p>use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations</p></li>
<li><p>provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or</p></li>
<li><p>handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="country">Country</p>
<p><strong>An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally.</strong></p>
<p>Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>worldwide economic disruption</p></li>
<li><p>heightened volatility in financial markets</p></li>
<li><p>severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments</p></li>
<li><p>substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region</p></li>
<li><p>disruption of global trade, and</p></li>
<li><p>diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and</p>
<p>earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chases-business-and-operations-in-certain-countries-can-be-adversely-affected-by-local-economic-political-regulatory-and-social-factors.">JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.</p>
<p>Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>extreme currency fluctuations</p></li>
<li><p>high inflation</p></li>
<li><p>low or negative growth, and</p></li>
<li><p>defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange</p></li>
<li><p>expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and</p></li>
<li><p>changes in laws, rules and regulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes</p></li>
<li><p>crime and corruption</p></li>
<li><p>security and personal safety issues</p></li>
<li><p>an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities</p></li>
<li><p>overthrow of incumbent governments</p></li>
<li><p>terrorist attacks, and</p></li>
<li><p>other forms of internal discord.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="people">People</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s increased use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain employees.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="unfavorable-changes-in-immigration-or-travel-policies-could-adversely-affect-jpmorgan-chases-businesses-and-operations.">Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to</p>
<p>make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="legal">Legal</p>
<p><strong>JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.</strong></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.</p>
<p>Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the</p>
<p>U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.</p>
<p>If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.</p>

<p>Refer to Capital actions in the Capital Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis on page 94 for information regarding repurchases under the Firm’s common share repurchase program.</p>
<p>Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its common share repurchase program, which superseded the previously approved repurchase program under which the Firm was authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares.</p>
<p>On July 14, 2022, the Firm announced that it had temporarily suspended share repurchases in anticipation of the increase in the Firm's regulatory capital requirements. The Firm had set a target for achieving CET1 capital of 13.0% by the first quarter of 2023. The Firm met and exceeded that target in the fourth quarter of 2022, and resumed repurchasing shares under its common share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during 2022 were as follows.</p>

<p>The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 155.</p>
<p>As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and</p>
<p>31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.</p>
<p>The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 155 for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule</p>
<p>13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to</p>
<p>materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $37.7 billion for 2022, down 22%, earnings per share of $12.09, ROE of 14% and ROTCE of 18%.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Total net revenue</strong> was $128.7 billion, up 6%, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%, driven by higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Net interest income excluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%.</p></li>
<li><p>Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in Home Lending and lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) in Corporate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Noninterest expense</strong> was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural expense and continued investments in the business, including compensation, technology and marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenue- related expense.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>provision for credit losses</strong> was $6.4 billion, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and</p></li>
<li><p>$2.9 billion of net charge-offs.</p></li>

<li><p>The Firm’s <strong>nonperforming assets</strong> totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion, predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales.</p></li>
<li><p>Firmwide <strong>average loans</strong> of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans across the LOBs.</p></li>
<li><p>Firmwide <strong>average deposits</strong> of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by the impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM, and</p></li>

<p><strong>War in Ukraine</strong></p>
<p>The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain. The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close positions and reduce certain of its business activities and exposures connected with the war, and to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks.</p>
<p>The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However, the Firm continues to monitor potential secondary impacts of the war, including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, that could have adverse effects on the Firm’s businesses.</p>
<p>The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk Management on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on pages 142-144 for additional information.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Form 10-K, “Russia” refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management framework; and “Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition</strong></p>
<p>The Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final stages of the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs in accordance with the International Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one- month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (“LIBOR Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the notional amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry milestones and recommendations published by National Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of the Firm’s remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The Firm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will remediate approximately 40% of the Firm’s remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives exposure will be remediated predominantly through contractual fallback provisions.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may not otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required to continue to publish the one-month, three-month and six- month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a “synthetic” basis which would allow market participants to use such rates through September 30, 2024. This proposal would apply to contracts that are outside the scope of the LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed publication of “synthetic” LIBOR are intended to facilitate, and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation.</p>
<p>The Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk management systems in connection with the transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its operational systems and models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative developments relating to the transition from LIBOR. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 153 for additional information.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a loss of $836 million in Credit Adjustments &amp; Other in CIB, compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior year.

<p><strong>Lending- and deposit-related fees</strong> increased due to higher service fee volume in CCB, predominantly offset by lower cash management fees in CB and CIB due to a higher level of credits earned by clients and applied against such fees. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Asset management, administration and commissions revenue</strong> decreased driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from lower average market levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers, and net long-term inflows,</p></li>
<li><p>lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily associated with lower average market values of assets under custody, and</p></li>
<li><p>lower brokerage commissions, largely in AWM, reflecting reduced volumes,</p></li>

<p>largely offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in the prior year primarily driven by updates to model inputs related to prepayment expectations, and</p></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and 15 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Card income</strong> decreased driven by higher amortization related to new account origination costs, partially offset by higher annual fees in CCB, and higher payments revenue on volume growth in commercial cards in CIB and CB.</p>

<p>The <strong>provision for credit losses</strong> was $6.4 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses and $2.9 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$2.3 billion in <strong>wholesale</strong>, driven by deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and</p></li>
<li><p>$1.2 billion in <strong>consumer</strong>, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and Banking &amp; Wealth Management (“BWM”) as net charge- offs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and an increase of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$76 million in CIB.</p>

<p><strong>Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks</strong> decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits across the LOBs and loan growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.</p>
<p><strong>Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements</strong> increased, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making activities and on collateral requirements in Markets,</p></li>
<li><p>higher demand for securities to cover short positions in Fixed Income Markets, and</p></li>
<li><p>an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Securities borrowed</strong> decreased driven by Markets, reflecting lower client-driven activities and lower demand for securities to cover short positions in Equity Markets.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed.</p>
<p><strong>Trading assets</strong> increased due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher derivative receivables, primarily in foreign exchange, as a result of market movements, and</p></li>
<li><p>an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Investment securities</strong> decreased, driven by lower available- for-sale (“AFS”) securities, partially offset by higher held-to- maturity (“HTM”) securities, which includes the impact of the transfer of $78.3 billion of securities from AFS to HTM in 2022, for capital management purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, as well as unrealized losses, which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”),</p></li>
</ul>
<p>largely offset by net purchases, and</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the increase in HTM securities also reflected purchases partially offset by paydowns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 130 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment securities.</p>
<p><strong>Loans</strong> increased, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher balances in Card Services driven by higher consumer spending and net new originations,</p></li>
<li><p>higher originations and revolver utilization in CB, and</p></li>
<li><p>higher wholesale loans in CIB, partially offset by</p></li>
<li><p>lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and</p></li>
<li><p>the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>allowance for loan losses</strong> increased, reflecting a net addition of $3.3 billion to the allowance for loan losses, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$2.1 billion in <strong>wholesale</strong>, resulting from deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and</p></li>
<li><p>$1.2 billion in <strong>consumer,</strong> predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There was also a $121 million addition to the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities</p>
<p>on the Consolidated balance sheets, and a $54 million addition to the allowance for investment securities.</p>
<p>Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.</p>
<p><strong>Accrued interest and accounts receivable</strong> increased due to higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets, as well as higher receivables in Payments related to the timing of payment activities, with December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Premises and equipment</strong>, refer to Note 16 and 18 for additional information.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="selected-consolidated-balance-sheets-data-1">Selected Consolidated balance sheets data</p>
<p><strong>Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles</strong> increased reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates and net additions, partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows, and</p></li>
<li><p>additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Renovite Technologies, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2022, Global Shares PLC and Figg, Inc. in the third quarter of 2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.</p></li>

<p><strong>Deposits</strong> decreased reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,</p></li>
<li><p>net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate environment, and</p></li>
<li><p>a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements</strong> increased due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets, partially offset by</p></li>
<li><p>lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Short-term borrowings</strong> decreased predominantly as a result of lower financing requirements in Markets.</p>
<p>Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; and also to Notes 2 and 17 for deposits and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Trading liabilities</strong> increased due to client-driven market- making activities, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Accounts payable and other liabilities</strong> increased due to higher client payables related to client-driven activities in Markets, including Prime Finance, as well as higher payables in Payments related to the timing of payment activities, with December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend. Refer to Note 19 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs</strong> increased driven by higher issuance of commercial paper as a result of an increase in loan balances in the Firm-administered multi- seller conduits. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term debt</strong> decreased driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and CIO as a result of higher rates, and a decline in the fair value of structured notes in Markets,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>largely offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>net issuances of senior debt in Treasury and CIO and structured notes in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 for additional information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stockholders’ equity</strong> reflects net unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO.

<p>JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="non-gaap-financial-measures">Non-GAAP financial measures</p>
<p>The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 159-163. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies.</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow</p>
<p>management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.</p>
<p>Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.</p>
<p>The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.</p>

<p>In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with CIB Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management believes that these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.</p>

<li><p>Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense, and</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Management believes that these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s performance.</p>
<p>The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="tce-rotce-and-tbvps">TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS</p>
<p>TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.</p>

<p><strong>Description of business segment reporting methodology</strong> Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.</p>
<p><em>Revenue sharing</em></p>
<p>When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.</p>
<p><em>Expense Allocation</em></p>
<p>Where business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally</p>
<p>allocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate.</p>
<p>Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular business segment.</p>
<p><em>Funds transfer pricing</em></p>
<p>Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.</p>
<p>The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments.</p>
<p>As a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net interest income. During the period ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits.</p>
<p><em>Foreign exchange risk</em></p>
<p>Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for additional information.</p>
<p><em>Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation</em></p>
<p>As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="segment-results-managed-basis">Segment Results – Managed Basis</p>
<p>business segment’s net income applicable to common equity.</p>
<p>Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for additional information.</p>
<p><em>Capital allocation</em></p>
<p>The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), Basel III Advanced RWA, the global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of updates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.</p>
<p>Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional information on capital allocation.</p>
<p>The following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="compared-with-2021-4">2022 compared with 2021</p>
<p>Net income was $14.9 billion, down 29%, reflecting a net increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year.</p>
<p>Net revenue was $55.0 billion, an increase of 10%.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $39.9 billion, up 22%, predominantly driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>margin expansion on higher rates as well as growth in deposits in Banking &amp; Wealth Management (“BWM”), and higher revolving loans in Card Services,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower NII associated with PPP loan forgiveness in BWM, and tighter loan spreads in Home Lending.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, down 13%, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending,</p></li>
<li><p>lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, and</p></li>
<li><p>lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to new account origination costs partially offset by higher annual fees in Card Services, while net interchange income was relatively flat,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting the absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in the prior year primarily driven by updates to model inputs related to prepayment expectations, as well as higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced,</p></li>
<li><p>higher commissions reflecting travel-related services in Card Services and increased annuity sales in BWM, and</p></li>
<li><p>higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee volume in BWM.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income and asset management, administration and commissions. Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.</p>
<p>Noninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>investments in the business and higher structural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, technology and marketing,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, predominantly driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher operating losses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>net charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion in the prior year and included</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>largely offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses driven by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and</p></li>
<li><p>$175 million in Home Lending.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB.</p>

<p>Net income was $15.0 billion, down 29%. Net revenue was $47.9 billion, down 7%.</p>
<p>Banking revenue was $15.3 billion, down 23%.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investment Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, down 48%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, which were also down 48%, as volatile market conditions resulted in lower fees across products, and $251 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in the second quarter of 2022. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%, and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, down 43%, due to lower issuance activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a lower level of announced deals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Payments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion, up 33%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees on higher volumes.</p></li>
<li><p>Lending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by higher net interest income primarily on higher loans, as well as fair value gains on hedges of retained loans, compared with losses in the prior year.</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up 10%, driven by strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly in Currencies &amp; Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.</p></li>
<li><p>Equity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%, driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by Equity Derivatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Securities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees, largely offset by lower average market values of assets under custody and lower deposits.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit Adjustments &amp; Other was a loss of $836 million, reflecting funding spread widening, and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Noninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural expense and investments in the business, including higher compensation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation as well as lower legal expense.</p>
<p>The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.</p>
<p>The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.</p>
<p>Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items.</p>
<p>Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory- related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the</p>
<p>difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Banking provides comprehensive financial solutions, including lending, payments, investment banking and asset management products across three primary client segments: Middle Market Banking, Corporate Client Banking and Commercial Real Estate Banking. Other includes amounts not aligned with a primary client segment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Middle Market Banking covers small and midsized companies, local governments and nonprofit clients.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corporate Client Banking covers large corporations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Real Estate Banking covers investors, developers, and owners of multifamily, office, retail, industrial and affordable housing properties.</strong></p>
<p>Net income was $4.2 billion, down 20%, reflecting a net increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year.</p>
<p>Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net interest income was $8.2 billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in loans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs and lower deposits.</p>
<p>Noninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were partially offset by a gain on an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star:</strong> Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry- wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share</p></li>
</ul>
<p>class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-</p>
<p>adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years)</strong>:All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“<strong>Primary share class</strong>” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.</p>

<p>Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>The current period income tax benefit was driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements as well as other tax adjustments, partially offset by a change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.</p>

Treasury and CIO overview</h2>
<p>Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off- balance sheet assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high- quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset- liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.</p>
<p>The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.</p>

<p><span id="_bookmark37" class="anchor"></span>Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;</p></li>
<li><p>Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and</p></li>
<li><p>A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.</p>
<p><strong>Risk governance framework</strong></p>
<p>The Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.</p>
<p><em>Drivers of risks</em> are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.</p>
<p><em>Types of risks</em> are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including</p></li>
</ul>
<p>consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.</p></li>
<li><p>Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Impacts of risks</em> are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.</p>
<p>The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.</p>
<p>The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk and control standards.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="three-lines-of-defense">Three lines of defense</p>
<p>The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows:</p>
<p>The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense own the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of controls to manage those risks.</p>
<p>Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM, which may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls.</p>
<p>The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is separate from, and independently assesses and challenges, the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own processes.</p>
<p>The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-identification-and-ownership">Risk identification and ownership</p>
<p>The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm’s business and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-appetite">Risk appetite</p>
<p>The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Risk governance and oversight structure</strong></p>
<p>The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="board-oversight">Board oversight</p>
<p>The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s financial performance and condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities through its principal standing committees, each of which consists solely of independent members of the Board. The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control environment, and the Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee oversees compensation and other management-related matters. Each committee of the Board oversees reputational risks, conduct risks, and ESG matters within its scope of responsibility.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, which it discharges both acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board</p>
<p>Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other management- related matters, the Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee.</p>
<p><em>The Board Risk Committee</em> assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.</p>
<p><em>The Audit Committee</em> assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, independence and performance of the Firm’s independent registered public accounting firm, and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.</p>
<p><em>The Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee (“CMDC”)</em> assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance of Operating Committee members against their goals, and approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s award is subject to ratification by the independent directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the “tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture, including reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions with respect to employees, including compensation actions.</p>
<p><em>The Public Responsibility Committee</em> oversees and reviews the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on these matters to management and the Board, as appropriate.</p>
<p><em>The Corporate Governance &amp; Nominating Committee</em> exercises general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="management-oversight">Management oversight</p>
<p>The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:</p>
<p><em>The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”)</em> is the Firm’s highest management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a forum for discussion of topics, and issues that are raised or escalated by its members and other committees.</p>
<p><em>The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”)</em> is an escalation committee for senior management to review and discuss the Firmwide operational risk environment including identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant events that have been escalated.</p>
<p><em>Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees</em> are responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and controls that have been established within the scope of their respective activities. These committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees.</p>
<p><em>Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees</em> oversee the operational risk and control environment of their respective business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of operational risk in a business or function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an emphasis on processes with control concerns and overseeing control remediation.</p>
<p><em>The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”)</em> is responsible for overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management (“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and capital risk.</p>
<p><em>The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”)</em> is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.</p>
<p><strong>Risk governance and oversight functions</strong></p>
<p>The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or business activity may include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="strategic-risk-management"> <u>STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="management-and-oversight">Management and oversight</p>
<p>The Operating Committee, together with the senior leadership of each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business discussions and decision-making, including participation in relevant business reviews and senior management meetings, risk and control committees and other relevant governance forums, and acquisition and new business initiative reviews. The Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk governance framework.</p>
<p>In the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk appetite.</p>
<p>In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile of the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and includes components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles, the Operating Committee and senior management teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the strategic framework and performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.</p>
<p>The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s assessment, are provided to the Board as part of its review and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and the plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.</p>
<p>The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk- adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 105 for further information on reputation risk.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="capital-risk-management"> <u>CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.</p>
<p>A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="capital-risk-management-1">Capital risk management</p>
<p>The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm.</p>
<p>Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:</p>

</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="capital-management">Capital management</p>
<p>Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;</p></li>
<li><p>Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;</p></li>
<li><p>Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;</p></li>

<li><p>Meet capital distribution objectives; and</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm addresses these objectives through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;</p></li>
<li><p>Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events; and</p></li>
<li><p>Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.</p></li>

Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="capital-planning-and-stress-testing">Capital planning and stress testing</p>
<p><em>Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review</em></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year.</p>
<p>On June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had completed the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test process. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up from 3.2%), and the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, of 12.0% (up from 11.2%).</p>
<p>The 2022 SCB requirement became effective on October 1, 2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p><em>Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process</em></p>
<p>Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the capital planning framework.</p>
<p>Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="contingency-capital-plan">Contingency Capital Plan</p>
<p>The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="regulatory-capital">Regulatory capital</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The</p>
<p>U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.</p>
<p><em>Basel III Overview</em></p>
<p>The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off- balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.</p>
<p>Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators.</p>
<p>Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93 for additional information.</p>
<p><em>Key Regulatory Developments CECL regulatory capital transition.</em></p>
<p>Until December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected a two</p>
<p>year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three- year period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.</p>
<p>Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.</p>
<p><em>Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk</em>. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the</p>
<p>U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.</p>
<p>The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized RWA.</p>
<p><em>Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements</em></p>
<p>The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.</p>
<p>All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.</p>
<p>Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital requirements.</p>
<p>Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. “Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For 2023, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has increased to 2.5% and 4.0%, respectively.</p>

<p>Method 2 4.0 % 3.5 % 3.5 %</p>
<p>On November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of December 31, 2021, which affirmed the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective</p>
<p>January 1, 2024. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%.</p>
<p>Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.</p>
<p>Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.</p>
<p><em>Risk-based Capital Targets</em></p>
<p>The Firm’s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect.</p>
<p><em>Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity</em></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top- tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for additional information.</p>
<p><em>Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio</em></p>
<p>Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer.</p>
<p>The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.</p>
<p>Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.</p>
<p><em>Other regulatory capital</em></p>
<p>In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.</p>
<p>The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Note 27 for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s risk-based and leverage- based capital metrics.</p>

Line of business equity</p>
<p>Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.</p>
<p>The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of updates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.</p>

<li><p>On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.</p></li>

<p>The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The</p>
<p>$30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for example, during internal trading blackout periods.</p>

<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="liquidity-risk-management-1">Liquidity risk management</p>
<p>The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;</p></li>
<li><p>Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;</p></li>
<li><p>Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;</p></li>
<li><p>Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness based on LRM’s Independent Review Framework;</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and</p></li>
<li><p>Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="liquidity-management">Liquidity management</p>
<p>Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and</p></li>
<li><p>Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm addresses these objectives through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;</p></li>
<li><p>Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;</p></li>
<li><p>Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity- specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;</p></li>
<li><p>Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;</p></li>
<li><p>Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and</p></li>
<li><p>Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Optimize liquidity sources and uses;</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor exposures;</p></li>
<li><p>Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm’s legal entities; and</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="governance-1">Governance</p>
<p>Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk- related committees.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="internal-stress-testing">Internal stress testing</p>
<p>Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets;</p></li>
<li><p>Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;</p></li>
<li><p>Considerations of credit rating downgrades;</p></li>
<li><p>Collateral haircuts; and</p></li>
<li><p>Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.</p>
<p>Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and</p>
<p>minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="contingency-funding-plan">Contingency funding plan</p>
<p>The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="lcr-and-hqla">LCR and HQLA</p>
<p>The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.</p>
<p>Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand- alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.</p>
<p>Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and</p>
<p>December 31, 2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.</p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with a decline in deposits, and loan growth.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in deposits as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.</p>
<p>The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="other-liquidity-sources">Other liquidity sources</p>
<p>In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above.</p>

<p>borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased credit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="nsfr">NSFR</p>
<p>The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s current interpretation of the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semiannually beginning in the second half of 2023.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="funding">Funding</h2>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="sources-of-funds">Sources of funds</p>
<p>Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements.</p>
<p>The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="deposits">Deposits</p>
<p>long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance sheet obligations.</p>

<p>Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.</p>
<p>Average deposits were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>growth in CCB from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers, partially offset by a decline in deposits starting in the second half of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending, and</p></li>
<li><p>net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by migration into investments starting in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of the rising interest rate environment</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower average deposits in CIB and CB due to attrition, also as a result of the rising interest rate environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Period-end deposits decreased reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,</p></li>
<li><p>net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate environment, and</p></li>
<li><p>a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in deposits for both spot and averages in Corporate was driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.</p>
<p>Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.</p>
<p>Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.</p>
<p>Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-</p>
<p>U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.</p>

<p>The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.</p>
<p>The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.</p>
<p>The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds.</p>
<p>The decrease in period-end commercial paper and the increase in average balances for the year ended</p>
<p>December 31, 2022 compared to the respective prior year periods, was due to changes in net issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="long-term-funding-and-issuance">Long-term funding and issuance</p>
<p>Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.</p>
<p>The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="credit-ratings">Credit ratings</p>
<p>The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it</p>
<p>maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.</p>

<p>On September 29, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the Parent Company’s long-term issuer rating to A1 (previously A2) and changed the long-term outlook to stable (previously positive). All other ratings and outlooks of the Parent Company and those of the Firm's principal bank and non- bank subsidiaries were affirmed by Moody's.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.</p>
<p>Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reputation-risk-management"> <u>REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader public.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="organization-and-management">Organization and management</p>
<p>Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.</p>
<p>The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk framework</p></li>
<li><p>Overseeing the governance execution through processes and infrastructure that support consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The types of events that result in reputation risk are wide- ranging and may be introduced by the Firm’s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="governance-and-oversight"><br />
Governance and oversight</p>
<p>The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider any other activity.</p>
<p>Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly important considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s reputation risk governance.</p>
<p>Reputation risk issues that are deemed to be material are escalated as appropriate.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="credit-and-investment-risk-management"> <u>CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="credit-risk-management">Credit risk management</p>
<p>Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.</p>
<p>Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining a credit risk policy framework</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval</p></li>
<li><p>Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure</p></li>
<li><p>Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and</p></li>
<li><p>Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-identification-and-measurement"><br />
Risk identification and measurement</p>
<p>To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.</p>
<p>Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information.</p>
<p>In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending- related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="stress-testing">Stress testing</p>
<p>Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-monitoring-and-management">Risk monitoring and management</p>
<p>The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.</p>
<p>Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.</p>
<p>Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing.</p>
<p>Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loan underwriting and credit approval processes</p></li>
<li><p>Loan syndications and participations</p></li>
<li><p>Loan sales and securitizations</p></li>
<li><p>Credit derivatives</p></li>
<li><p>Master netting agreements, and</p></li>
<li><p>Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-reporting">Risk reporting</p>
<p>To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision- making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management.</p>
<p>Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real estate loans.</p>
<p>The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Residential real estate:</strong> The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.</p>
<p>Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower gross charge-offs.</p>
<p>Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB.</p>
<p>The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $15.7 billion at December 31, 2022. This amount included $5.1 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.</p>

The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for further information on modifications for the years ended</p>

<p>and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher- balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>Auto and other</strong>: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared with December 31, 2021 due to paydowns of scored Auto loans and PPP loan forgiveness in Business Banking predominantly offset by originations of scored Auto loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year due to higher scored Auto and overdraft charge- offs, as the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.24% and 0.04% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>

<p>(a) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="credit-card">Credit card</h2>
<p>Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 driven by growth in balances on higher consumer spending and net new originations. The December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net charge- offs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending.</p>
<p>Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans</strong> At December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the total retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="modifications-of-credit-card-loans">Modifications of credit card loans</p>
<p>At December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. These TDRs do not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and modifications.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="wholesale-credit-portfolio"> <u>WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO</u> </h3>
<p>In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further information.</p>
<p>The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.</p>
<p>In 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by</p>
<p>$43.3 billion driven by CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, largely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and CB.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9 billion from</p>
<p>$38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million driven by a decline in lending-related commitments in CIB and loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and cancelled commitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 50 and Country Risk on pages 139-140 for additional information. Refer to Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures on pages 118-121 for additional information.</p>

<p>The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.</p>
<p>Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer &amp; Retail, Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on industry concentrations.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="lending-related-commitments">Lending-related commitments</p>
<p>The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="receivables-from-customers">Receivables from customers</p>
<p>Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="derivative-contracts">Derivative contracts</p>
<p>Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short</p>
<p>maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.</p>
<p>The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.</p>
<p>In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.</p>
<p>In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.</p>
<p>The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.</p>

<p>While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.</p>
<p>Peak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management.</p>
<p>DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.</p>
<p>Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.</p>
<p>The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of</p>
<p>management process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.</p>
<p>The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.</p>

</ol>
<p>The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="allowance-for-credit-losses"> <u>ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES</u> </h3>
<p>The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,</p></li>
<li><p>the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and</p></li>
<li><p>the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Discussion of changes in the allowance</em></p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and</p></li>
<li><p>$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="investment-portfolio-risk-management"> <u>INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="investment-securities-risk">Investment securities risk</p>
<p>Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon</p>

Principal investment risk</p>
<p>Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.</p>

<p><em>Governance and oversight</em></p>
<p>Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk Committee.</p>
<p>The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.</p>

<p><em>Governance and oversight</em></p>
<p>The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for all principal investing activities that includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="market-risk-management"> <u>MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="market-risk-management-1">Market Risk Management</p>
<p>Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining a market risk policy framework</p></li>
<li><p>Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk</p></li>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="measures-used-to-capture-market-risk">Measures used to capture market risk</p>
<p>There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Value-at-risk (VaR)</p></li>
<li><p>Stress testing</p></li>
<li><p>Profit and loss drawdowns</p></li>

</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-monitoring-and-control">Risk monitoring and control</p>
<p>Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.</p>
<p>Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.</p>
<p>Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.</p>
<p>Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148.</p>
<p>Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.</p>
<p>In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 130 for additional discussion on principal investments.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="value-at-risk">Value-at-risk</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.</p>
<p>The framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.</p>
<p>Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.</p>
<p>As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.</p>
<p>For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress</p>
<p>testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.</p>
<p>The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.</p>
<p>The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 for information regarding model reviews and approvals.</p>
<p>The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.</p>
<p>Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).</p>
<p>The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.</p>

<p>The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.</p>
<p>A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.</p>
<p>For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and observed 17 VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.</p>
<p>The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses</strong></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="other-risk-measures">Other risk measures</h2>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="stress-testing-1">Stress testing</p>
<p>Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits.</p>
<p>The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.</p>
<p>The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="profit-and-loss-drawdowns">Profit and loss drawdowns</p>
<p>Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="earnings-at-risk">Earnings-at-risk</p>
<p>The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the</p>
<p>Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.</p>
<p>The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.</p>
<p>Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments</p></li>
<li><p>Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off- balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time</p></li>
<li><p>Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long- term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)</p></li>
<li><p>The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.</p>
<p>One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans,</p>
<p>deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132.</p>
<p>Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long- term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits.</p></li>
<li><p>The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a positive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a negative impact, on the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of the</p>
<p>Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information).</p>
<p>The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.</p>

<p>(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021.</p>
<p>The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher interest rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the</p>
<p>+/-100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a +/-100 basis points shift in long-term rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing.</p>
<p>The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.</p>

<p>The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="non-u.s.-dollar-foreign-exchange-risk">Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk</p>
<p>Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.

<p><span id="_bookmark45" class="anchor"></span>The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="organization-and-management-1">Organization and management</p>
<p>Country Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm’s country risk management function includes the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm</p></li>
<li><p>Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management</p></li>
<li><p>Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns</p></li>
<li><p>Providing country risk scenario analysis</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="sources-and-measurement">Sources and measurement</p>
<p>The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country.</p>
<p>Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation.</p>
<p>Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables).</p>
<p>Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an</p>
<p>individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.</p>
<p>Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions</p></li>
<li><p>Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received</p></li>
<li><p>Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received</p></li>
<li><p>Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions</p></li>
<li><p>Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received</p></li>
<li><p>Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="stress-testing-2">Stress testing</p>
<p>Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="risk-reporting-1">Risk reporting</p>
<p>Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.</p>
<p>For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.</p>
<p>The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.</p>
<p>The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central bank of Australia and government debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at the Russian National Settlement Depository. In accordance with requirements of the Bank of Russia, these deposits were transferred to the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia on February 3, 2023.</p>

<p><span id="_bookmark46" class="anchor"></span>Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of climate change on the Firm’s clients, customers, operations and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk.</p>
<p>Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures.</p>
<p>Transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a low- carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="operational-risk-management"> <u>OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="operational-risk-management-framework">Operational Risk Management Framework</p>
<p>The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk.</p>
<p><em>Operational Risk Governance</em></p>
<p>The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and</p>
<p>Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.</p>
<p><em>Operational Risk Identification</em></p>
<p>The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self- assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.</p>
<p><em>Operational Risk Measurement</em></p>
<p>Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the results to senior management.</p>
<p>In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.</p>
<p>The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.</p>
<p>As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.</p>
<p>The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress testing processes.</p>
<p>Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.</p>
<p><em>Operational Risk Monitoring and testing</em></p>
<p>The results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate.</p>
<p><em>Management of Operational Risk</em></p>
<p>The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.</p>
<p><em>Operational Risk Reporting</em></p>
<p>All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.</p>
<p><strong>Subcategories and examples of operational risks</strong> Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as cybersecurity, business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing are provided below.</p>
<p><em>War in Ukraine and Sanctions</em></p>
<p>In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with addressing these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations.</p>
<p><em>Cybersecurity risk</em></p>
<p>Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data,</p>
<p>disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.</p>
<p>The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p>Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred.</p>
<p>To help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a Information Security Program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically provided with updates on the Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as the Firm’s efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response</p>
<p>plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement and other government agencies, and notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.</p>
<p>The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization, working with each of the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, is responsible for identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and is responsible for the controls to manage threats. The organization consists of business aligned information security personnel that are supported within the organization by the following products and services that execute the Information Security Program for the Firm:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cyber Operations</p></li>
<li><p>Identity &amp; Access Management</p></li>
<li><p>Governance, Risk &amp; Controls</p></li>
<li><p>Global Technology Product Security</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other matters as appropriate.</p>
<p>The IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for certain employee roles such as application developers.</p>
<p>Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information.</p>
<p><em>Business and technology resiliency risk</em></p>
<p>Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks.</p>
<p><em>Payment fraud risk</em></p>
<p>Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings.</p>
<p><em>Third-party outsourcing risk</em></p>
<p>The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to a high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group</p>
<p>is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="insurance">Insurance</p>
<p>One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.</p>
<p>Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="overview">Overview</p>
<p>Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and services to clients and customers.</p>
<p>These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations varying across the LOBs and Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.</p>
<p>Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="governance-and-oversight-2"><br />
Governance and oversight</p>
<p>Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite.</p>
<p>The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on significant compliance risk issues, as appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Code of Conduct</em></p>
<p>The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern employee conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm does business. The Code requires employees to promptly report any potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code annually.</p>
<p>Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all times globally, with translation services. It is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="conduct-risk-management"> <u>CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="overview-1">Overview</p>
<p>Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides information and resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 145 for further discussion of the Code.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="governance-and-oversight-3">Governance and oversight</p>
<p>The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR Management policy, which establishes the framework for governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee conduct framework and reviewing the consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.</p>
<p>Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each designated corporate function completes an assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides conduct education as appropriate.</p>
<p>Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="overview-2">Overview</p>
<p>The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:</p>

<p>Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="estimations-and-model-risk-management"> <u>ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.</p>
<p>The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.</p>
<p>The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in detail below.</p>
<p>Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.</p>
<p>Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.</p>
<p>Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.</p>
<p>While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as the Firm experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.</p>
<p><span id="_bookmark48" class="anchor"></span>JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="allowance-for-credit-losses-1">Allowance for credit losses</p>
<p>The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),</p></li>
<li><p>The allowance for lending-related commitments, and</p></li>
<li><p>The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.</p></li>
<li><p>Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.</p>
<p>To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.</p>
<p>For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 127 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight- quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately 8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the</p>
<p>Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An increase of approximately $500 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments</p></li>
<li><p>An increase of approximately $2.2 billion for credit card loans</p></li>
<li><p>An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.</p>
<p>Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2022.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="fair-value"><br />
Fair value</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.</p>

<p><em>Valuation</em></p>
<p>Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.</p>
<p>For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.</p>
<p>Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.</p>
<p>The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="goodwill-impairment"><br />
Goodwill impairment</p>
<p>Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15.</p>
<p>Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.</p>
<p>For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of</p>
<p>December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.</p>
<p>The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with management’s current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long- term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="credit-card-rewards-liability">Credit card rewards liability</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.</p>
<p>The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates</p>
<p>to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $315 million.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="income-taxes">Income taxes</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting period.</p>
<p>Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted.</p>
<p>The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is</p>
<p>established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.</p>
<p>The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.</p>
<p>Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made.</p>
<p>The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate.</p>

<p><em><strong>Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control - Integrated Framework</em> (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).</p>
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control – Integrated Framework</em> (2013) issued by the COSO.</p>
<p><em>Change in Accounting Principle</em></p>
<p>As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="basis-for-opinions">Basis for Opinions</p>
<p>The Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.</p>
<p>Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="definition-and-limitations-of-internal-control-over-financial-reporting">Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</p>
<p>A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>

<p><em><strong>Critical Audit Matters</strong></em></p>
<p>The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.</p>
<p><em>Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios</em></p>
<p>As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio- based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $17.0 billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $785.9 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are</p>
<p>U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.</p>
<p>The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are</p>
<p>(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in</p>
<p>evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables.</p>
<p><em>Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments</em></p>
<p>As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and</p>
<p>$453.7 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $13.6 billion of trading assets and $37.8 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates, correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates, and Bermudan switch values.</p>
<p>The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair value, including controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable inputs.</p>

<p>The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-1-basis-of-presentation">Note 1 – Basis of presentation</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.</p>
<p>The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="consolidation">Consolidation</p>
<p>The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.</p>
<p><em>Voting interest entities</em></p>
<p>Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.</p>
<p>Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.</p>
<p>Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non- affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members</p>
<p>have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest.</p>
<p>The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately- held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Variable interest entities</em></p>
<p>VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.</p>
<p>The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.</p>
<p>The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.</p>
<p>To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment</p>
<p>includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.</p>
<p>To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="revenue-recognition">Revenue recognition</p>
<p><em>Interest income</em></p>
<p>The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level- yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.</p>
<p><em>Revenue from contracts with customers</em></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers<em>,</em> in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers.</p>
<p><em>Principal transactions revenue</em></p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="use-of-estimates-in-the-preparation-of-consolidated-financial-statements"><br />
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements</p>
<p>The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="foreign-currency-translation">Foreign currency translation</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.</p>
<p>Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="offsetting-assets-and-liabilities">Offsetting assets and liabilities</p>
<p>U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.</p>
<p>The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.</p>
<p>Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="statements-of-cash-flows">Statements of cash flows</p>
<p>For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2023 <em>Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)</em></strong></p>
<p>The adoption of this guidance eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allows the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post- modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre- modification effective interest rate.</p>
<p>The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual</p>
<p>risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. See Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach.</p>
<p>This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of approximately</p>
<p>$600 million and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $450 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card.</p>

Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="financial-instruments-credit-losses-cecl">Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)</p>
<p>The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses represented management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-2-fair-value-measurement">Note 2 – Fair value measurement</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).</p>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.</p>
<p>The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.</p>
<p>The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="valuation-process">Valuation process</p>
<p>Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the</p>
<p>CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.</p>
<p><em>Price verification process</em></p>
<p>The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk- taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.</p>
<p>The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid- offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.</p></li>
<li><p>Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 184 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.</p></li>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="valuation-model-review-and-approval">Valuation model review and approval</p>
<p>If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.</p>
<p>Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="fair-value-hierarchy">Fair value hierarchy</p>
<p>A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.</p></li>
<li><p>Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.</p></li>
<li><p>Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.</p>
<p>The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.</p>

<p><strong>Classification in the fair value hierarchy</strong></p>
<p>Structured notes (included in deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt)</p>
<p>Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note.</p>
<p>The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 184 of this Note.</p>

<li><p>Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.</p></li>

<li><p>Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $950 million and $801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were trading assets of $43 million and $51 million, respectively, and other assets of $907 million and $750 million, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $9.7 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.8 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $2.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="level-3-valuations">Level 3 valuations</p>
<p>The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.</p>
<p>Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.</p>
<p>The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.</p>
<p>In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="changes-in-and-ranges-of-unobservable-inputs">Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs</p>
<p>The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.</p>
<p>The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions.</p>
<p>Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.</p>
<p>Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.</p>
<p>The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.</p>
<p>Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.</p>
<p>Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.</p>
<p>Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself.</p>
<p>Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market- making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.</p>
<p>Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.</p>
<p>The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument- specific factors.</p>
<p>Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.</p>
<p>The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.</p>
<p>Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.</p>
<p>The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.</p>
<p>Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder.</p>
<p>Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement<em>.</em></p>
<p>Interest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow.</p>
<p>Forward price – Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.</p>
<p>The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="changes-in-level-3-recurring-fair-value-measurements">Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements</p>
<p>The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk- manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives</strong> Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally</p>
<p>necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.</p>
<p>CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a</p>
<p>each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.</p>
<p>The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.</p>

<p>FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities</p>
<p>The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI.

<p>Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) recorded at a nominal carrying value. In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of</p>
<p>$914 million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firm’s sale of 20 million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares that it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. As a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="additional-disclosures-about-the-fair-value-of-financial-instruments-that-are-not-carried-on-the-consolidated-balance-sheets-at-fair-value">Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value</p>
<p>U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table.</p>
<p><em>Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value</em></p>
<p>Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and</p>
<p>accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be</p>
<p>equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.</p>
<p>The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at</p>
<p>December 31, 2022 and 2021, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.</p>

<li><p>Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-3-fair-value-option">Note 3 – Fair value option</h2>
<p>The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.</p>
<p>The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.</p>
<p>The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending- related commitments</p></li>
<li><p>Certain securities financing agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument</p></li>
<li><p>Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities</p></li>

<p>The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery</p></li>
</ul>
<p>information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market.</p></li>
<li><p>Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-4-credit-risk-concentrations">Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations</h2>
<p>Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite.</p>
<p>In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.</p>
<p>The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans.</p>
<p>The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk.</p>
<p>Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.</p>
<p>The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The wholesale industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-5-derivative-instruments">Note 5 – Derivative instruments</h2>
<p>Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market- making or risk management purposes.</p>
<p><em>Market-making derivatives</em></p>
<p>The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.</p>
<p><em>Risk management derivatives</em></p>
<p>The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability.</p>
<p>Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.</p>
<p>Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.</p>
<p>Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages</p>
<p>205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.</p>
<p>Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.</p>
<p><em>Derivative counterparties and settlement types</em></p>
<p>The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.</p>
<p><em>Derivative clearing services</em></p>
<p>The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="accounting-for-derivatives">Accounting for derivatives</p>
<p>All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.</p>
<p>As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 198-205 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.</p>
<p><em>Derivatives designated as hedges</em></p>
<p>The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives.</p>
<p>However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes.</p>
<p>To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.</p>
<p>There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment.</p>
<p>Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are</p>
<p>recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.</p>
<p>The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="liquidity-risk-and-credit-related-contingent-features">Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features</p>
<p>In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.</p>
<p>While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2022 and 2021.</p>

<p>The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.</p>

<p>In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP.

<p><em>Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives</em></p>
<p>The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="credit-derivatives-1"><br />
Credit derivatives</p>
<p>Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.</p>
<p>The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses.</p>
<p>Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.</p>
<p><em>Credit default swaps</em></p>
<p>Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&amp;P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.</p>
<p>For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.</p>
<p><em>Credit-related notes</em></p>
<p>A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.</p>
<p>The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not included in the table below.</p>
<p>The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.</p>

<p><strong>Noninterest revenue</strong></p>
<p>The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="investment-banking-fees-1">Investment banking fees</p>
<p>This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.</p>
<p>The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction.</p>

Principal transactions</p>
<p>Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and</p></li>
<li><p>realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.</p></li>
<li><p>Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.</p>
<p>Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;</p></li>
<li><p>derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities.</p>
<p>In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.</p>
<p>The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense.</p>
<p>Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.</p>

<p>The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co- brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co- brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co- brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years.</p>
<p>The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-8-pension-and-other-postretirement-employee-benefit-plans">Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans</h2>
<p>The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the</p>
<p>U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their accumulated balances.</p>
<p>The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their</p>
<p>dependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="gains-and-losses">Gains and losses</p>
<p>Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans.</p>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a</p>
<p>pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan’s projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain was predominantly attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets and the discount rate.</p>

<p>The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long- term returns for the various asset classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each plan.</p>
<p>The discount rates used in determining the benefit obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined benefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows.</p>

<p><strong>Investment strategy and asset allocation</strong></p>
<p>The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. The approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-3% real estate, and 0-12% alternatives as of December 31, 2022.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="employee-share-based-awards">Employee share-based awards</p>
<p>In 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted long- term share-based awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans.</p>
<p>RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances.</p>
<p>Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.</p>
<p>Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three- year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.</p>
<p>Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.</p>
<p>Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in 2022 and grants in 2020 were not material.</p>
<p>The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date.</p>
<p>Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.</p>
<p>The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="rsus-psus-sars-and-stock-options-activity">RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity</p>
<p>Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2022.</p>

<p>At December 31, 2022, approximately $1.0 billion (pretax) of compensation expense related to unvested</p>
<p>awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share- based compensation awards to employees.</p>

Tax benefits</p>
<p>Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) related to share-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $901 million, $957 million and $837 million, respectively.</p>
<p><span id="_bookmark55" class="anchor"></span>Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities.</p>
<p>AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security.</p>
<p>However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.</p>
<p>During 2022 and 2021, the Firm transferred $78.3 billion and $104.5 billion of investment securities, respectively, from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains/(losses) of $(4.8) billion and $425 million, respectively, on the securities at the dates of transfer.</p>
<p>Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.</p>
<p>Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded at fair value.</p>
<p>The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.</p>

<p>At December 31, 2022, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&amp;P and Moody’s,</p>
<p>however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.</p>

<p>AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost.</p>
<p>The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the security.</p>
<p>For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI.</p>
<p>Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security.</p>
<p>When assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.</p>
<p>For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.</p>

HTM securities – credit risk</p>
<p><em>Allowance for credit losses</em></p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities.</p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.</p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security.</p>
<p>The application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.</p>
<p><em>Credit quality indicator</em></p>
<p>The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 98% rated at least AA+.</p>

<li><p>Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.</p></li>

<p>JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash.</p>
<p>Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.</p>
<p>Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="credit-risk-mitigation-practices">Credit risk mitigation practices</p>
<p>Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of</p>
<p>December 31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with</p>
<p>securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="transfers-not-qualifying-for-sale-accounting">Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting</p>
<p>At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held $692 million and $440 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-12-loans">Note 12 – Loans</h2>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-accounting-framework">Loan accounting framework</p>
<p>The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)</p></li>
<li><p>Loans held-for-sale</p></li>
<li><p>Loans at fair value</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm’s loans by category:</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loans-held-for-investment">Loans held-for-investment</p>
<p>Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees.</p>
<p><em>Interest income</em></p>
<p>Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.</p>
<p>The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.</p>
<p><em>Nonaccrual loans</em></p>
<p>Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.</p>
<p>Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.</p>
<p>On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.</p>
<p>A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.</p>
<p>As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.</p>
<p><em>Allowance for loan losses</em></p>
<p>The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.</p>
<p><em>Charge-offs</em></p>
<p>Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due.</p>
<p>Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government- guaranteed portion of loans.</p>
<p>Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral.</p>
<p>When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.</p>
<p>For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”).</p>
<p>Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- specific factors.</p>
<p>For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loans-held-for-sale"><br />
Loans held-for-sale</p>
<p>Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.</p>
<p>Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.</p>
<p>Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.</p>
<p>Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge- off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loans-at-fair-value">Loans at fair value</p>
<p>Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.</p>
<p>Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.</p>
<p>Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-classification-changes">Loan classification changes</p>
<p>Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for- sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.</p>
<p>In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-modifications">Loan modifications</p>
<p>The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.</p>
<p>Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification.</p>
<p>Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re- default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="foreclosed-property"><br />
Foreclosed property</p>
<p>The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).</p>
<p>The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue.</p>
<p>Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-portfolio">Loan portfolio</p>
<p>The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Residential real estate<sup>(a)</sup></p></li>
<li><p>Auto and other<sup>(b)</sup></p></li>

<li><p>Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.</p></li>
<li><p>The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.</p></li>
<li><p>Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note 14 for more information on SPEs.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="consumer-excluding-credit-card-loan-portfolio">Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio</h2>
<p>Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.</p>
<p>Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.</p></li>

<p>Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.</p>

Loan modifications</p>
<p>Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.</p>
<p>The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="credit-card-loan-portfolio">Credit card loan portfolio</h2>
<p>The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.</p>
<p>While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The</p>
<p>distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.</p>
<p>The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.</p>
<p>The following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-modifications-3">Loan modifications</p>
<p>The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.</p>
<p>Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.</p>
<p>If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.</p>
<p><em>Financial effects of modifications and redefaults</em></p>
<p>The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.</p>

</ol>
<p>For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="wholesale-loan-portfolio">Wholesale loan portfolio</h2>
<p>Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p>The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.</p>
<p>Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&amp;P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.</p>
<p>Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.</p>
<p>Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.</p>
<p>As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-modifications-4">Loan modifications</p>
<p>Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $801 million, $881 million and $734 million, respectively. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflected the extension of maturity dates, covenant waivers, receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments, predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.</p>
<p>The carrying value of TDRs was $936 million and $607 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-13-allowance-for-credit-losses">Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses</h2>
<p>The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,</p></li>
<li><p>the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and</p></li>
<li><p>the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.</p>
<p>Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.</p>
<p>The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="methodology-for-allowances-for-loan-losses-and-lending--related-commitments">Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending- related commitments</p>
<p>The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending- related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.</p>
<p>The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date)</p>
<p>versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first.</p>
<p>The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.</p>
<p><em>Collective and Individual Assessments</em></p>
<p>When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.</p></li>
<li><p>Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments.</p>
<p>If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral- dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.</p>
<p><em>Portfolio-based component</em></p>
<p>The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using</p>
<p>a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management.</p>
<p>The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties.</p>
<p>The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.</p>
<p><em>Asset-specific component</em></p>
<p>To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets.</p>
<p>The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate.</p>
<p>Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be</p>
<p>recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral).</p>
<p>The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms.</p>
<p>Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.</p>

<p><em>Discussion of changes in the allowance</em></p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and</p></li>
<li><p>$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:</p>

<p>Refer to Note 1 on page 164 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.</p>

<p>The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Asset &amp; Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third- party transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third parties.</p>

<p>CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.</p>
<p>The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the</p>
<p>trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant.</p>
<p>The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors.</p>
<p>The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of</p>
<p>December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $6.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal</p>
<p>receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 62% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts</strong></em> The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.</p>
<p>The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.</p>

The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion of investment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $131 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021; noninvestment-grade retained interests were not material at December 31, 2022. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $5.8 billion and $3.5 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $1.1 billion and $929 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Residential mortgage</em></p>
<p>The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization.</p>
<p>In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.</p>
<p>The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust.</p>
<p><em>Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations</em> CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.</p>
<p><em>Re-securitizations</em></p>
<p>The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.</p>
<p>The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.</p>

<p>U.S. GSEs and government</p>
<p>agencies <strong>$ 16,128</strong> $ 53,923 $ 46,123</p>
<p>Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.</p>
<p>The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re- securitization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re- securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="multi-seller-conduits">Multi-seller conduits</p>
<p>Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal- specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal- specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.</p>
<p>To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal- specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.</p>
<p>The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held</p>
<p>$13.8 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.</p>
<p>Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were</p>
<p>$10.6 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="municipal-bond-vehicles">Municipal bond vehicles</p>
<p>Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events</p>
<p>(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.</p>
<p>Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="consolidated-vie-assets-and-liabilities">Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities</p>
<p>liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.</p>
<p>TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="vies-sponsored-by-third-parties">VIEs sponsored by third parties</p>
<p>The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.</p>
<p><em>Tax credit vehicles</em></p>
<p>The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.</p>
<p><em>Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)</em></p>
<p>The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.</p>
<p>The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was</p>
<p>$5.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion respectively.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-securitizations"><br />
Loan securitizations</p>
<p>The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.</p>
<p>For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).</p>
<p>For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.</p>

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government- sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines</p>
<p>In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the</p>
<p>U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization- related indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.</p>

<p><em>Goodwill impairment testing</em></p>
<p>The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.</p>
<p>The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized</p>
<p>for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.</p>
<p>The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.</p>
<p>The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values.</p>
<p>These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions.</p>
<p>The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.</p>
<p>Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="mortgage-servicing-rights"><br />
Mortgage servicing rights</p>
<p>MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.</p>
<p>As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.</p>
<p>The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.</p>
<p>Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm</p>
<p>receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.</p>

<p>Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear.

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-16-premises-and-equipment">Note 16 – Premises and equipment</h2>
<p>Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term, or estimated useful life of the improvements.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life.</p>
<p>Impairment is assessed periodically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable.</p>

<p>less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.</p>
<p>Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="firm-as-lessor">Firm as lessor</p>
<p>The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.</p>
<p>The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees.</p>

The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $45.3 billion and $46.4 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $5 million and $12 million accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

<li><p>The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.</p></li>
<li><p>At December 31, 2022, long-term debt in the aggregate of $194.9 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.</p></li>
<li><p>The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2022 is $32.2 billion in 2023, $40.1 billion in 2024, $34.3 billion in 2025, $32.5 billion in 2026 and $22.8 billion in 2027.</p></li>

<p>The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.26% and 2.67% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 4.89% and 1.43% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $28.2 billion and $16.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<p>The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.</p>
<p>At December 31, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm, JPMorgan Chase’s preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the quarterly dividend declarations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.</p>

<p>Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its common share repurchase program, which superseded the previously approved repurchase program under which the Firm was authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares. In the second half of 2022, as a result of the expected increases in regulatory capital requirements, the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the Firm resumed repurchasing shares under its common share repurchase program.</p>
<p>preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the regulatory capital framework.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The</p>
<p>$30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for example, during internal trading blackout periods.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, approximately 58.9 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-23-earnings-per-share">Note 23 – Earnings per share</h2>
<p>Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the</p>
<p>two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information.</p>
<p>Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.</p>
<p>The following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.</p>

<p>underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.</p>
<p>Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.</p>

<p>Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not.

<p>JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $365 million at December 31, 2022, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2022, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were $648 million, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $308 million, FTC carryforwards were</p>
<p>$81 million, state and local capital loss carryforwards were</p>
<p>$1.0 billion, and other U.S. federal tax attributes were</p>
<p>$256 million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2039 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030, and the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026.</p>
<p>The valuation allowance at December 31, 2022, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.</p>

<p>$4.3 billion, respectively, of which $3.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits</p>

<p>addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $1.0 billion.

</ul>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="intercompany-funds-transfers"><br />
Intercompany funds transfers</p>
<p>Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk- based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital.</p>
<p>The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).</p>
<p>The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors.</p>
<p>At January 1, 2023, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $34 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-27-regulatory-capital">Note 27 – Regulatory capital</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized requirements, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.</p>
<p>The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.</p>
<p>The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below:</p>
<p>Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators.</p>

<p><em>CECL regulatory capital transition</em></p>
<p>Until December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected a two year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three- year period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.</p>
<p>Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.</p>
<p>The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-28-offbalance-sheet-lending-related-financial-instruments-guarantees-and-other-commitments">Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.</p>
<p>To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.</p>

<p>U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.</p>
<p>As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non- contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received),</p>
<p>or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.</p>
<p>Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).</p>
<p>The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 277.</p>
<p>For additional information on the guarantees, see below.</p>
<p><em>Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees</em> Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.</p>

<p>(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.</p>
<p><em>Securities lending indemnifications</em></p>
<p>Through the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.</p>
<p>The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested.</p>
<p><em>Derivatives qualifying as guarantees</em></p>
<p>The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less.</p>
<p>Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.</p>
<p>The notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount.</p>
<p>The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.</p>

<p>In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="unsettled-securities-financing-agreements">Unsettled securities financing agreements</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date.</p>
<p>These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="loan-sales--and-securitization-related-indemnifications">Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications</p>
<p><em>Mortgage repurchase liability</em></p>
<p>In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm.</p>
<p><em>Private label securitizations</em></p>
<p>The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation.</p>
<p><em>Loans sold with recourse</em></p>
<p>The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae</p>
<p>or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property.</p>
<p>The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="other-off-balance-sheet-arrangements">Other off-balance sheet arrangements</p>
<p><em>Indemnification agreements – general</em></p>
<p>In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third- party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.</p>
<p><em>Merchant charge-backs</em></p>
<p>Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.</p>
<p>For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,158.4 billion, $1,886.7 billion, and $1,597.3 billion, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk</em></p>
<p>The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.</p>
<p>As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member.</p>
<p>The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p><em>Exchange &amp; Clearing House Memberships</em></p>
<p>The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange &amp; clearing house guarantees and commitments line.</p>
<p><em>Sponsored member repo program</em></p>
<p>The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote.</p>
<p>The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &amp; clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.</p>
<p><em>Guarantees of subsidiaries</em></p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s</p>
<p>counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.</p>
<p>The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 277 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-30-litigation">Note 30 – Litigation</h2>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="contingencies">Contingencies</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.</p>
<p>The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,</p></li>
<li><p>the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,</p></li>
<li><p>the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and</p></li>
<li><p>the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.</p>
<p>Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.</p>
<p><em>1MDB Litigation</em>. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim.</p>
<p><em>Amrapali</em>. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately</p>
<p>$31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation.</p>
<p><em>Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.</em> JPMorgan Chase Bank,</p>
<p>N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were</p>
<p>instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank,</p>
<p>N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. In November 2022, the Court refused permission to the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded.</p>
<p><em>Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.</em> The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities.</p>
<p>Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.</p>
<p>With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval.</p>
<p><em>Interchange Litigation</em>. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on</p>
<p>appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</p>
<p>The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.</p>
<p>Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa- branded payment card sales volume.</p>
<p><em>Jeffrey Epstein Litigation.</em> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has moved to dismiss both complaints.</p>
<p><em>LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation.</em> JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that</p>
<p>decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.</p>
<p>In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.</p>
<p><em>Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation</em>. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions.</p>
<p>Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.</p>
<p><em>Shareholder Litigation</em>. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.</p>
<p>Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust</p>
<p>enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action.</p>
<p>A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.</p>
<p>The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $266 million, $426 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.</p>
<p>In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-31-international-operations">Note 31 – International operations</h2>
<p>The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk.</p>
<p>However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses.</p>
<p>As of or for the year ended December 31,</p>
<p>Income before income tax</p>
<p>As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32.</p>
<p>The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-32-business-segments">Note 32 – Business segments</h2>
<p>The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer &amp; Community Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &amp; Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results of this footnote for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.</p>
<p>The following is a description of each of the Firm’s business segments, and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="consumer-community-banking">Consumer &amp; Community Banking</p>

<p>The Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, which consists of Banking and Markets &amp; Securities Services, offers a broad suite of investment banking, market-making, prime brokerage, lending, and treasury and securities products and services to a global client base of corporations, investors, financial institutions, merchants, government and municipal entities.

Markets &amp; Securities Services also includes</p>
<p>Securities Services, a leading global custodian which provides custody, fund accounting and administration, and securities lending products principally for asset managers, insurance companies and public and private investment funds.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="commercial-banking-1">Commercial Banking</p>
<p>Commercial Banking provides comprehensive financial solutions, including lending, payments, investment banking and asset management products across three primary client segments: Middle Market Banking, Corporate Client Banking and Commercial Real Estate Banking. Other includes amounts not aligned with a primary client segment.</p>
<p>Middle Market Banking covers small and midsized companies, local governments and nonprofit clients.</p>
<p>Corporate Client Banking covers large corporations.</p>
<p>Commercial Real Estate Banking covers investors, developers, and owners of multifamily, office, retail, industrial and affordable housing properties.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="asset-wealth-management-1">Asset &amp; Wealth Management</p>
<p>Asset &amp; Wealth Management, with client assets of $4.0 trillion, is a global leader in investment and wealth management.</p>
<p>Asset Management</p>

The major Other Corporate functions include Real Estate, Technology, Legal, Corporate Finance, Human Resources, Internal Audit, Risk Management, Compliance, Control Management, Corporate Responsibility and various Other Corporate groups.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="segment-results">Segment results</p>
<p>The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.</p>
<p>Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.</p>
<p><em>Capital allocation</em></p>
<p>Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.</p>
<p>The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.</p>

<p>The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.</p>

The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="mortgage-product-types">Mortgage product types:</p>
<p><em>Alt-A</em></p>
<p>Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;</p>
<p>(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.</p>
<p><em>Option ARMs</em></p>
<p>The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.</p>
<p>Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.</p>
<p><em>Prime</em></p>
<p>Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting</p>
<p>requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.</p>
<p><em>Subprime</em></p>
<p>Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.</p>

<li><p><strong>Partner payments</strong>: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Net mortgage servicing revenue:</strong> Includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Net revenue rate:</strong> Represents Card Services net revenue (annualized) expressed as a percentage of average loans for the period.</p>
<p><strong>Net yield on interest-earning assets:</strong> The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.</p>
<p><strong>NFA:</strong> National Futures Association</p>
<p><strong>NM:</strong> Not meaningful</p>
<p><strong>NOL:</strong> Net operating loss</p>
<p><strong>Nonaccrual loans:</strong> Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.</p>
<p><strong>Nonperforming assets:</strong> Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.</p>

<p><strong>Overhead ratio:</strong> Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Parent Company:</strong> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>
<p><strong>Participating securities:</strong> Represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to</p>
<p>each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.</p>

<p><strong>PPP:</strong> Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Association (“SBA”)</p>
<p><strong>PRA:</strong> Prudential Regulation Authority</p>
<p><strong>Pre-provision profit/(loss):</strong> Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-tax margin:</strong> Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which management evaluates the performance of AWM against the performance of their respective competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Principal transactions revenue:</strong> Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and</p></li>
<li><p>realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.</p></li>
<li><p>Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.</p></li>

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive</p>
<p>approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="outstanding-preferred-stock">Outstanding Preferred Stock</p>
<p>As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, we have 18 series of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The shares of each series of our preferred stock are represented by depositary shares, with each depositary share representing a fractional interest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series. Of the 18 series of our issued and outstanding preferred stock, depositary shares representing the following six series of preferred stock are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with each depositary share representing a 1/400th interest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>5.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD;</p></li>
<li><p>6.00% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE;</p></li>
<li><p>4.75 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series GG;</p></li>
<li><p>4.55% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series JJ;</p></li>
<li><p>4.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series LL; and</p></li>
<li><p>4.20% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We refer to the above six series of preferred stock herein collectively as the “Listed Preferred Stock”. The Listed Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable.</p>
<p>The terms of the depositary shares are summarized below under “Description of Depositary Shares”.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="ranking">Ranking</p>
<p>The Listed Preferred Stock ranks, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding- up, on a parity with any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock and to any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock. The Listed Preferred Stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="dividend-rights">Dividend Rights</p>
<p>Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates described below under “Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. We will pay each dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register on record dates determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on the Listed Preferred Stock are noncumulative. If a dividend is not declared on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, because the dividends are noncumulative, then the right of holders of that series to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.</p>
<p>We may not declare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for payment, or we contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends on that series of Listed Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that series, all dividends declared and paid upon the shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the that series will be declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, we will allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividends due on shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of any series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock and (ii) in the case of any series of cumulative preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock.</p>
<p>In addition, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Listed Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment in respect of the applicable most recently completed dividend period, with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our common stock or upon any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding- up, and</p></li>
<li><p>no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally with that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such capital stock) by us, except:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;</p></li>
<li><p>as a result of reclassification into capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;</p></li>
<li><p>through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of shares of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock or, in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock,</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;</p>
<ol start="4" type="i">
<li><p>in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock, pursuant to pro rata offers to purchase all or a pro rata portion of the shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and such capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;</p></li>
<li><p>in connection with the satisfaction of our obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course prior to the beginning of the most recently completed dividend period; or</p></li>
<li><p>any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock pursuant to any of our or our subsidiaries’ employee, consultant or director incentive or benefit plans or arrangements (including any employment, severance or consulting arrangements) adopted before or after the issuance of that Listed Preferred Stock).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, the foregoing will not restrict our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to engage in underwriting, stabilization, market-making or similar transactions in our capital stock in the ordinary course of business. Subject to the conditions described above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our common stock and any other capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.</p>
<p>As used herein, “junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to our common stock and any other class or series of our capital stock over which the Listed Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; “parity preferred stock” and “on a parity with a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity with the shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; and “senior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks senior to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require.</p>
<p>We will compute the amount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number of dividend periods in a year, except that the amount of dividends payable for any period greater or less than a full dividend period, other than the initial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any period less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="rights-upon-liquidation-1">Rights Upon Liquidation</p>
<p>In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series of Listed Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the amount of $10,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock of such series. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets.</p>
<p>If, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, and any stock having the same rank as that series, the holders of that series and of that other stock will share ratably in any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are entitled. For any series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the sale of all or substantially all of our property or business, nor our merger or consolidation into or with any other entity will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary of or involuntary, of us.</p>
<p>Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and our stockholders, including the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock, to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon that subsidiary’s liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.</p>
<p>Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are subordinate to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets, including in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. In addition, holders of the Listed Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="redemption">Redemption</p>
<p>We may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock on the dates and at the redemption prices set forth below under “Specific Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. In addition, we may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to $10,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends,</p>
<p>following the occurrence of a capital treatment event. For these purposes, “capital treatment event” means the good faith determination by JPMorgan Chase that, as a result of any:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>amendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock;</p></li>
<li><p>proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock; or</p></li>
<li><p>official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>there is more than an insubstantial risk that JPMorgan Chase will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full liquidation amount of all shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock then outstanding as “additional Tier 1 capital” (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of such series of Listed Preferred Stock is outstanding. Redemption of any Listed Preferred Stock may be subject to our receipt of any required approvals from the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory authority.</p>
<p>If we elect to redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, we will provide notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed. Such mailing will be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice so mailed will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of the series designated for redemption will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of that series. Each notice of redemption will state:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the redemption date;</p></li>
<li><p>the number of shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;</p></li>
<li><p>the redemption price;</p></li>
<li><p>the place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and</p></li>
<li><p>that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the series of Listed Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or “DTC”, we may give such notice in any manner permitted or required by DTC. For each series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the holders of a series nor the holders of the related depositary shares have the right to require redemption of such series of Listed Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>In the case of any redemption of only part of the shares a series of Listed Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of the series to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of that series in proportion to the number of shares held by such holders or by lot. From and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on the shares of Listed Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date and all rights of the holders of those shares, except the right to receive the redemption price, will cease.</p>
<p>In the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, we may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series, except by a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="preemptive-and-conversion-rights">Preemptive and Conversion Rights</p>
<p>The Listed Preferred Stock is not subject to any preemptive rights and is not convertible into property or shares of any other class or series of our capital stock.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="depositary-transfer-agent-and-registrar">Depositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar</p>
<p>Computershare Inc. is the depositary, transfer agent and registrar for each series of the Listed Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="voting-rights-1">Voting Rights</p>
<p>Except as indicated below or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote. Each share of Listed Preferred Stock a series is entitled to one vote on matters on which holders of that series are entitled to vote. The voting power of each series of Listed Preferred Stock depends on the number of shares in that series, and not on the aggregate liquidation preference or initial offering price of the shares of that series.</p>
<p>If, at any time or times, the equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, for any series of Listed Preferred Stock has not been paid, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be automatically increased by two and the holders of each outstanding series of Listed Preferred Stock with such voting rights, together with holders of such other shares of any other class or series of parity preferred stock outstanding at the time upon which like voting rights have been conferred</p>
<p>and are exercisable, which we refer to as “voting parity stock,” voting together as a class, will be entitled to elect those additional two directors, which we refer to as “preferred directors,” at that annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full dividends have been paid for at least four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that time such right will terminate, except as expressly provided in the applicable certificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the preferred directors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in office will terminate immediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected. Any preferred director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of the Listed Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with the holders of shares of voting parity stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy created by removal with or without cause may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any preferred director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining preferred director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.</p>
<p>So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remains outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series and any voting parity stock, voting together as a class, authorize, create or issue any capital stock ranking senior to that series as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock. So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series, amend, alter or repeal any provision of the applicable certificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation, including by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of that series.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of any series of Listed Preferred Stock:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock, or any increase or decrease in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to that series of Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;</p></li>
<li><p>a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in which the shares of that series remain outstanding; and</p></li>
<li><p>a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in which the shares of the that series are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly, controlling such surviving entity and such new preference securities have powers, preferences and special rights that are not materially less favorable than that series;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>provided that if the amendment would adversely affect such series but not any other series of preferred stock outstanding, then the amendment will only need to be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock adversely affected.</p>
<p>In exercising the voting rights described above or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by us, each share of Listed Preferred Stock with respect to a series will be entitled to one vote (equivalent to 1/400<sup>th</sup> of a vote per relevant depositary share).</p>
<p>If we redeem or call for redemption all outstanding shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock and irrevocably deposit in trust sufficient funds to effect such redemption, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required or upon which the holders of such series will be entitled to vote will be effected, the voting provisions described above will not apply.</p>
<p>Our board of directors may also from time to time, without notice to or consent of holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of such series. Delaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a class on any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations) that would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or decrease the par value of such class or adversely affect the powers, preferences and special rights of the shares of preferred stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as permitted by law, our certificate of incorporation provides that any increase or decrease in our authorized capital stock may be adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of capital stock representing not less than a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one or more series of preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class of preferred stock, only the shares of the series so affected will be considered a separate class for purposes of this vote on the amendment. This right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations).</p>
<p>Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any series of our preferred stock become entitled to vote for the election of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be deemed a “class of voting securities.” In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a holder of 5% or more if that holder would also be considered to exercise a “controlling influence” over JPMorgan Chase, may then be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5% or more of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="description-of-depositary-shares">Description of Depositary Shares</p>
<p>The following summary of the terms of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock is not complete. You should refer to each of the deposit agreements among us, the depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares relating to each series of the Listed Preferred Stock for the complete terms of those depositary shares. Each of those deposit agreements has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed in connection with the issuance of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock.</p>
<p><em>General.</em> Each depositary share represents a 1/400<sup>th</sup> interest in a share of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, and is evidenced by depositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited shares of that series of Listed Preferred Stock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement relating to that series of Listed Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of each deposit agreement, the depositary shares are entitled to all the powers, preferences and special rights of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, as applicable, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Listed Preferred Stock those depositary shares represent.</p>
<p><em>Dividends and Other Distributions.</em> Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/400<sup>th</sup> of the dividend declared and payable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>The depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock to the holders of record of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder. In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the depositary receipts as nearly as practicable in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder, unless the depositary determines that this distribution is not feasible, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of the property and distribution of the net proceeds of that sale to the holders of the depositary receipts.</p>
<p>Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the related shares of Listed Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>The amount paid as dividends or otherwise distributable by the depositary with respect to the depositary shares or the underlying Listed Preferred Stock will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on account of taxes or other governmental charges.</p>
<p><em>Redemption of Depositary Shares.</em> If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the corresponding depositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be 1/400<sup>th</sup> of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Listed Preferred Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends.</p>
<p>If we redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Listed Preferred Stock so redeemed. If we redeem less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary will select pro rata or by lot those depositary shares to be redeemed. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares.</p>
<p>The redemption of depositary shares that are held in book-entry form through DTC will be effected in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC.</p>
<p><em>Voting the Listed Preferred Stock.</em> Because each depositary share represents a 1/400<sup>th</sup> interest in a share of Listed Preferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400<sup>th</sup> of a vote per depositary share under those limited circumstances in which holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote.</p>
<p>When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to that Listed Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for</p>
<p>the applicable Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares.</p>
<p><em>Withdrawal of Listed Preferred Stock.</em> Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary arrangement upon surrender of depositary receipts at the depositary’s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and fees provided for in the deposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of depositary receipts will receive the appropriate number of shares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn; if a holder holds an amount other than a whole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will deliver along with the withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive depositary shares.</p>
<p><em>Form and Notices.</em> Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the depositary shares representing that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC. The depositary will forward to the holders of depositary shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are delivered to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock.</p>
<p><em>Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement</em>. We and the depositary may amend any form of depositary receipt evidencing depositary shares and any provision of any deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary shares. However, any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares representing a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock or would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to holders of that underlying Listed Preferred Stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the related depositary shares then outstanding. The deposit agreement relating to the depositary shares representing a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock may be terminated by us or by the depositary only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>all such outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed; or</p></li>
<li><p>there has been a final distribution of the relevant underlying Listed Preferred Stock in connection with our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and the preferred stock has been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Charges of Depositary.</em> We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements regarding any depositary shares. We also pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial deposit of each series of Listed Preferred Stock and any redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock. Holders of depositary receipts will pay transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and other charges with respect to their depositary receipts as expressly provided in the deposit agreement.</p>
<p><em>Resignation and Removal of Depositary.</em> With respect to the depositary shares representing each series of Listed Preferred Stock, the depositary may resign at any time by delivering a notice to us of its election to do so. We may remove the depositary at any time. Any such resignation or removal will take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of its appointment.</p>
<p>We must appoint a successor depositary within 60 days after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal.</p>
<p><em>Miscellaneous.</em> The depositary will forward to holders of applicable depositary receipts all reports and communications from us that we deliver to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the relevant Listed Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>Neither we nor the depositary will be liable if either of us is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our control in performing our respective obligations under any deposit agreement. Our obligations and those of the depositary will be limited to performing in good faith our respective duties under any deposit agreement. Neither we nor the depositary will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding relating to any depositary shares or Listed Preferred Stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished. We and the depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or accountants, or upon information provided by persons presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of depositary receipts or other persons we believe to be competent, and on documents we believe to be genuine.</p>

<p class="heading unnumbered" id="description-of-the-alerian-mlp-index-etns-due-may-24-2024">DESCRIPTION OF THE ALERIAN MLP INDEX ETNS DUE MAY 24, 2024</p>
<p>The following description of our Alerian MLP Index ETNs due May 24, 2024 (the “Alerian ETNs”) is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated May 25, 2001 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2001 Indenture”), between JPMorgan Chase, as issuer, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to the Form 10-K. We encourage you to read the 2001 Indenture for additional information.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="general">General</p>
<p>In June 2012, the maximum number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance was set at 129,000,000, resulting in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2,455,722,690. All of the Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance were issued as of June 2012. 10,000,000 Alerian ETNs were retired on December 16, 2015. Accordingly, since the retirement of these notes, the maximum number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance is 119,000,000 with an aggregate principal amount of $2,265,356,590, all of which has been issued and remain outstanding as of December 31, 2019.</p>
<p>The Alerian ETNs are linked to the Alerian MLP Index (the “Index”) and are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank <em>pari passu</em> with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Alerian ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity or upon early repurchase. <strong>Any payment on the Alerian ETNs is subject to the credit risk of</strong></p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-co.">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The Alerian ETNs are part of a series of our debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series E” (the “Series E Notes”) that we may issue under the 2001 Indenture from time to time. For more information about the Series E Notes, please see the section titled “General Terms of the Series E Notes” below.</p>
<p>The Alerian ETNs are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Alerian ETNs are registered on the books that we or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in the Alerian ETNs (registered in street name or otherwise).</p>
<p>Please see “Certain Defined Terms” below for an explanation of any capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="the-index">The Index</p>
<p>The return of the Alerian ETNs is linked to the performance of the Index. The Index measures the composite performance of energy- oriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, and is calculated and maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Calculation Agent”), in consultation with GKD Index Partners, LLC (the “Index Sponsor”), using a float-adjusted, market capitalization methodology. MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural resource.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="denominations">Denominations</p>
<p>The Alerian ETNs are denominated in U.S. dollars in minimum denominations equal to the $19.03661 per note (the “Principal Amount”), which is the amount equal to the Initial VWAP Level (defined below), <em>divided</em> by ten.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="coupon-payments-and-the-accrued-tracking-fee">Coupon Payments and the Accrued Tracking Fee</p>
<p>For each Alerian ETN a holder holds on the applicable Coupon Record Date, holders will receive on each Coupon Payment Date the “Coupon Amount,” which is an amount in cash equal to the difference between (a) the Reference Distribution Amount (defined below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date and (b) the Accrued Tracking Fee (defined below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date.</p>
<p>The Accrued Tracking Fee accrues on a daily basis at a rate of 0.85% per annum, applied to the Daily Note Value as of the Index Business Day immediately preceding the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date. The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative performance of the VWAP Level of the Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date. If the Daily Note Value increases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will increase, and if the Daily Note Value decreases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will decrease. The Daily Note Value is published on the Bloomberg Professional<sup>®</sup> service (“Bloomberg”) under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP” and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP:IND.”</p>
<p>On any Index Business Day, the VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, and the VWAP of each Index Component is the volume-weighted average price of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent based on the Primary Exchange for that Index Component.</p>
<p>To the extent the Reference Distribution Amount on any Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date, there will be no coupon payment made on the corresponding Coupon Payment Date, and an amount equal to the difference between the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Reference Distribution Amount (the “Tracking Fee Shortfall”) will be included in the Accrued Tracking Fee for the next Coupon Valuation Date. This will be in addition to the accrual at a rate of 0.85% per annum over the quarter that has elapsed since the previous date of determination. This process will be repeated to the extent necessary until the Reference Distribution Amount for a Coupon Valuation Date is greater than the Accrued Tracking Fee for the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date (which includes the accumulated Tracking Fee Shortfall from all prior quarters). This process may also restart as necessary on a subsequent Coupon Valuation Date. Coupon payments on the Alerian ETNs will be payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date, <em>provided</em> that the final Coupon Payment Date will be the Maturity Date. The final Coupon Amount will be included in the Cash Settlement Amount.</p>
<p>Holders will receive no coupon payment on a Coupon Payment Date if the Reference Distribution Amount on the relevant Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the relevant Coupon Valuation Date.</p>
<p>On each Index Business Day, the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the value of the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Index Business Day (treating that immediately preceding Index Business Day as if it were a Coupon Valuation Date), which we refer to as the interim accrued Coupon Amount, and will publish the interim accrued Coupon Amount on Bloomberg under the ticker symbol “AMJEU” and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJEU:IND.” While the interim accrued Coupon Amount is calculated and published in connection with each such Index Business Day, the actual Coupon Amount will be calculated and paid only once each quarter.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="payment-upon-early-repurchase">Payment Upon Early Repurchase</p>
<p>Subject to a holder's compliance with the procedures and the potential postponements and adjustments as described under “Market Disruption Events” below, that holder may submit a request once a week (generally on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on Thursday) during the term of the Alerian ETNs to have us repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, <em>provided</em> that holder requests that</p>
<p>we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs. If a holder requests that we repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, subject to the notification requirements and the other terms and conditions set forth under “Repurchase Requirements” below, for each Alerian ETN that holder will receive a cash payment on the relevant Repurchase Date equal to the Repurchase Amount. If the Repurchase Amount is $0 or less, the payment upon early repurchase will be $0. Because the Repurchase Amount is based on the value of the Index at the end of a five-day measurement period that begins after a repurchase request is received, holders will not know the Repurchase Amount they will receive at the time they elect to request that we repurchase their Alerian ETNs.</p>
<p>The Repurchase Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;</p></li>
<li><p>the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee;</p></li>
<li><p>the deduction of the Repurchase Fee;</p></li>
<li><p>the addition of other adjustments representing accrued but unpaid coupons, which include the following:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the Coupon Amount with respect to the Coupon Valuation Date immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date (generally the last Index Business Day of the week in which a repurchase is requested) if, on the last Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period the Coupon Ex-Date with respect to that Coupon Amount has not yet occurred. The Repurchase Measurement Period is a five-Index Business Day period commencing on the Repurchase Valuation Date during which the Final VWAP Level will be determined;</p></li>
<li><p>an Adjusted Coupon Amount, if any, that reflects certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates from and excluding the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date to and including the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date, less the Accrued Tracking Fee; and</p></li>
<li><p>certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement Period.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured on each Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.</p>
<p>The Repurchase Fee Amount is equal to 0.125% of the Principal Amount, adjusted to reflect:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;</p></li>
<li><p>the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and</p></li>
<li><p>the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement Period.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, the Repurchase Fee Amount will vary based on the performance of the Index, the Accrued Tracking Fee and certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement Period.</p>
<p>Holders may lose some or all of their investment upon early repurchase. Because the Accrued Tracking Fee reduces their final payment, holders will likely lose some or all of their principal amount upon early repurchase if the Final VWAP Level is less than the Initial VWAP Level or if the Final VWAP Level is not greater than the Initial VWAP Level by an amount that is sufficient to offset the negative effect of the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Repurchase Fee.</p>
<p><em>Repurchase Requirements</em></p>
<p>To exercise the right to have us repurchase a holder's Alerian ETNs on a weekly basis, that holder must instruct that holder's broker or other person through whom that holder holds the Alerian ETNs to take the following steps:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Different brokerage firms may have different deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers. Accordingly, holders should consult the brokerage firm through which they own their interest in the offered Alerian ETNs in respect of such deadlines. If we do not receive a holder's Repurchase Notice by 11:00 a.m., or a holder's Repurchase Confirmation by 4:00 p.m., on the Business Day</p>
<p>immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date, that holder's Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will not repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs on the relevant Repurchase Date.</p>
<p>The Note Calculation Agent will, in its sole discretion, resolve any questions that may arise as to the validity of a Repurchase Notice and the timing of receipt of a Repurchase Notice or as to whether and when the required deliveries have been made. Once given, a Repurchase Notice may not be revoked.</p>
<p><em>Expiration of Repurchase Rights</em></p>
<p>If we do not receive a holder's Repurchase Notice by 11:00 a.m., New York City time (as described under the first bullet point in “Repurchase Requirements” above), or a holder's Repurchase Confirmation by 4:00 p.m., New York City time (as described under the third bullet point in “Repurchase Requirements” above) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date (generally Thursday), that holder's Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will not repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs on the relevant Repurchase Date. Any Repurchase Notice for which we (or our affiliate) receive a valid Repurchase Confirmation in accordance with the procedures described above will be irrevocable.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="payment-at-maturity">Payment at Maturity</p>
<p>For each Alerian ETN, unless earlier repurchased, holders will receive at maturity a cash payment equal to the Cash Settlement Amount. If the Cash Settlement Amount is $0 or less, the payment at maturity will be $0.</p>
<p>The Cash Settlement Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;</p></li>
<li><p>the addition of the final Coupon Amount, if any,</p></li>
<li><p>the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and</p></li>
<li><p>the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Final Measurement Period.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Final Measurement Period is a five Index Business Day period near the Maturity Date of the Alerian ETNs during which the Final VWAP Level will be determined.</p>
<p>For purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured on each Index Business Day in the Final Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent. The Initial VWAP Level is the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured on each Index Business Day over a three Index Business Day period ending on the Inception Date, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.</p>
<p>Holders may lose some or all of their investment at maturity. Because the Accrued Tracking Fee reduces their final payment, holders will likely lose some or all of their principal amount at maturity if the Final VWAP Level is less than the Initial VWAP Level or if the Final VWAP Level is not greater than the Initial VWAP Level by an amount that is sufficient to offset the negative effects of the Accrued Tracking Fee.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="note-calculation-agent">Note Calculation Agent</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, or JPMS (the “Note Calculation Agent”), will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Alerian ETNs, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Alerian ETNs, other those to be made by the VWAP Calculation Agent described below.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="vwap-calculation-agent">VWAP Calculation Agent</p>
<p>The JPMorgan Global Index Research Group (the “VWAP Calculation Agent”), one of our affiliates, will on each day that is not a Disrupted Day (as defined below) act as the VWAP Calculation Agent. The VWAP Calculation Agent will determine the VWAP of any Index Component, the VWAP Level and the Final VWAP Level on any Index Business Day on which such VWAP, VWAP Level and Final VWAP Level are to be determined during the term of the Alerian ETNs.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="market-disruption-events">Market Disruption Events</p>
<p>To the extent a Disrupted Day (as defined below) exists with respect to an Index Component on an Averaging Date (as defined below), the VWAP and published share weighting with respect to such Index Component (and only with respect to such Index Component) for such Averaging Date will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates on the first succeeding Index Business Day that is not a Disrupted Day (the “Deferred Averaging Date”) with respect to such Index Component irrespective of whether pursuant to such determination, the Deferred Averaging Date would fall on a date originally scheduled to be an Averaging Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if the postponement described in the preceding sentence results in the VWAP of a particular Index Component being calculated on a day originally scheduled to be an Averaging Date, for purposes of determining the VWAP Levels on the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, the Note</p>
<p>Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, as the case may be, will apply the VWAP and the published share weighting with respect to such Index Component for such Deferred Averaging Date to the calculation of the VWAP Level (i) on the date(s) of the original disruption with respect to such Index Component and (ii) such Averaging Date.</p>
<p>In no event, however, will any postponement pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph result in the final Averaging Date with respect to any Index Component occurring more than three Index Business Days following the day originally scheduled to be the final Averaging Date. If the third Index Business Day following the date originally scheduled to be the final Averaging Date is not an Index Business Day or is a Disrupted Day with respect to such Index Component, the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, will determine the VWAP and share weighting with respect to any Index Component required to be determined for the purpose of calculating the applicable VWAP Level based on its good faith estimate of the VWAP and share weighting of each such Index Component that would have prevailed on the Primary Exchange on such third Index Business Day but for such suspension or limitation.</p>
<p>An “Averaging Date” means each of the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, subject to adjustment as described herein.</p>
<p>A “Disrupted Day” with respect to any Index Component is any Index Business Day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing, and, in both cases, the occurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material effect on the VWAP Level.</p>
<p>With respect to an Index Component, a “Market Disruption Event,” means:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the occurrence or existence of a condition specified below:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Primary Exchange for trading in the Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the Primary Exchange or otherwise;</p></li>
<li><p>any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Related Exchange for trading in futures or options contracts related to the Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by such Related Exchange or otherwise; or</p></li>
<li><p>any event (other than an event described in (b) below) that disrupts or impairs (as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) the ability of market participants in general (A) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for the relevant Index Component or (B) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, futures or options contracts relating to the relevant Index Component; or</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>the closure on any Index Business Day of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange prior to its Scheduled Closing Time unless such earlier closing time is announced by the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier of (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session on the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day and (ii) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange system for execution at the close of trading on such Index Business Day;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>in each case determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion; and</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>a determination by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion that the applicable event described above materially interfered with our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to adjust or unwind all or a material portion of any hedge with respect to the Alerian ETNs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of the above definition:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>a limitation on the hours or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from an announced change in the regular business hours of the Primary Exchange or Related Exchange, and</p></li>
<li><p>for purposes of clause (a) above, limitations pursuant to the rules of any Primary Exchange or Related Exchange similar to NYSE Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 (or any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any other self-regulatory organization or any government agency of scope similar to NYSE Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 as determined by the Note Calculation Agent) on trading during significant market fluctuations will constitute a suspension, absence or material limitation of trading.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Scheduled Closing Time” means, with respect to the Primary Exchange or the Related Exchange, on any Index Business Day, the scheduled weekday closing time of the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day, without regard to after hours or any other trading outside of the regular trading session hours.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="discontinuation-of-the-index-alteration-of-method-of-calculation">Discontinuation of the Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation</p>
<p>If the Index Calculation Agent discontinues publication of or otherwise fails to publish the Index, or the Index Calculation Agent does not make the Index Components, their share weighting and/or the Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent, and the Index Sponsor, the Index Calculation Agent or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Note Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued Index and for which the Index Components, their share weighting, and/or the Index Divisor are available to the VWAP Calculation Agent (such index being referred to herein as a “successor index”), then the VWAP Level for such successor index will be determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent by reference to the sum of the products of the VWAPs of the components underlying such successor index on the Primary Exchanges and each such component's respective weighting within the successor index (which sum will be adjusted by any index divisor used by such successor index) on the dates and at the times as of which the VWAP Levels for such successor index are to be determined.</p>
<p>Upon any selection by the Note Calculation Agent of a successor Index, the Note Calculation Agent will cause written notice thereof to be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs.</p>
<p>If the Index Calculation Agent discontinues publication of the Index or does not make the Index Components, their share weightings and/or Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent prior to, and such discontinuation or unavailability is continuing on the Calculation Date or any Index Business Day during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, or any other relevant date on which the VWAP Level is to be determined and the Note Calculation Agent determines that no successor index is available at such time, or the Note Calculation Agent has previously selected a successor index and publication of such successor index is discontinued prior to, and such discontinuation is continuing on the Calculation Date or any Index Business Day during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, or any other relevant date on which the VWAP Level is to be determined, then the Note Calculation Agent will determine the relevant VWAP Levels using the VWAP and published share weighting of each Index Component included in the Index or successor index, as applicable, immediately prior to such discontinuation or unavailability, as adjusted for certain corporate actions. In such event, the Note Calculation Agent will cause notice thereof to be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these alternative arrangements, discontinuation of the publication of the Index or successor index, as applicable, may adversely affect the value of the Alerian ETNs.</p>
<p>If at any time the method of calculating the Index or a successor index, or the value thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the Index or a successor index is in any other way modified so that the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index does not, in the opinion of the Note Calculation Agent, fairly represent the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Note Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a VWAP level of an index comparable to the Index or such successor index, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the VWAP Levels for the Index or such successor index with reference to the Index or such successor index, as adjusted. The Note Calculation Agent will accordingly calculate any values that reference the VWAP Levels based on the relevant VWAP Levels calculated by the Note Calculation Agent, as adjusted. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index or a successor index is modified so that the level of the Index or such successor index is a fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such modification (<em>e.g.</em>, due to a split in the index), which, in turn, causes the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index to be a fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such modification, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such calculations and adjustments in order to arrive at a VWAP Level for the Index or such successor index as if it had not been modified <em>(e.g.</em>, as if such split had not occurred).</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="payment-upon-an-event-of-default">Payment upon an Event of Default</p>
<p>In case an event of default with respect to the Alerian ETNs shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per Alerian ETN upon any acceleration of the Alerian ETNs will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to the Repurchase Amount, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the first Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period and the four Index Business Days immediately succeeding the date of acceleration were the corresponding Index Business Days in the accelerated Repurchase Measurement Period. For purposes of this calculation the Repurchase Fee Amount shall be zero.</p>
<p>If the maturity of the Alerian ETNs is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, we will, or will cause the Note Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs, of the cash amount due with respect to the Alerian ETNs as promptly as possible and in no event later than two Business Days after the date of acceleration.</p>

<p>In this “General Terms of the Series E Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series E Notes issued by JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, including the Alerian ETNs.</p>
<p>We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2001 Indenture and the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture. These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2001 Indenture, which describes completely the terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it. Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2001 Indenture. Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2001 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.</p>
<p>The debt securities will be our direct, unsecured general obligations and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.</p>
<p>We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. As a result, claims of the holders of the debt securities will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, except to the extent that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries. Claims of our subsidiaries' creditors other than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.</p>
<p><em>Events of Default and Waivers</em></p>
<p>An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture is defined in the 2001 Indenture as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>default for 30 days in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series;</p></li>
<li><p>default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;</p></li>
<li><p>failure by us for 90 days to perform any other covenants or warranties contained in the 2001 Indenture applicable to that series after written notice has been given by the trustee to us or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to us and the trustee;</p></li>
<li><p>specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary; or</p></li>
<li><p>any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture or form of security. (Section 5.01)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on the debt securities, or a failure in the performance of any covenant or agreement, or any other Event of Default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture or form of security, with respect to one or more (but in the case of a default in performance of a covenant or agreement, or in a manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security, less than all) series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. If a default in the performance of any covenant or agreement with respect to all series of debt securities, or in a manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security with respect to all series of debt securities, or due to specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all debt securities then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)</p>
<p>An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The 2001 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so. The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)</p>
<p>The 2001 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2001 Indenture. (Section 5.09) The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2001 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))</p>
<p>No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)</p>
<p>However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)</p>
<p>The 2001 Indenture requires us to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not we have knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05)</p>
<p><em>Covenant Breach</em></p>
<p>Under the 2001 Indenture, a “Covenant Breach” would occur with respect to a series of debt securities if we fail to perform or breach any of the covenants contained in the 2001 Indenture (other than a failure to pay principal or interest on the debt securities) and that failure or breach continues for 90 days after the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities give written notice of that failure or breach. Neither the Trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the debt securities as a result of any Covenant Breach.</p>
<p>If a Covenant Breach or Event of Default with respect to the debt securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders of the debt securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the 2001 Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the 2001 Indenture, or to enforce any other proper remedy.</p>
<p><em>Modification of the 2001 Indenture</em></p>
<p>The 2001 Indenture contains provisions permitting us and the Trustee to modify the 2001 Indenture or the rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification. Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2001 Indenture applicable to debt securities in foreign currencies;</p></li>
<li><p>change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>adversely affect the terms on which debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable or payable in other securities, instruments, contracts, currencies, commodities or other forms of property;</p></li>
<li><p>impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security; or</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification. (Section 8.02)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The 2001 Indenture also permits us and the Trustee to amend the 2001 Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence our merger or the replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2001 Indenture or our debt securities that we deem necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. (Section 8.01)</p>
<p><em>Consolidations, Mergers and Sales of Assets</em></p>
<p>We may not merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to any other entity (other than the sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to one or more of our direct or indirect subsidiaries), unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>either we are the continuing corporation or the successor entity or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred is a United States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2001 Indenture binding upon us, and</p></li>
<li><p>we or the successor entity will not, immediately after the merger or consolidation, sale, conveyance or transfer, be in default in the performance of any covenant or condition of the 2001 Indenture binding on us. (Section 9.01)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2001 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change of control of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or a highly leveraged transaction. The merger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of our assets. However, we may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which we would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.</p>
<p><em>Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent</em></p>
<p>Our subsidiaries and we have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, registrars, authenticating agents and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the trustee for other securities issued by us or JPMorgan Financial, including the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture, the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Financial's indenture for debt securities, to which we are a guarantor, and the warrants issued under JPMorgan Financial's warrant indenture, to which we are a guarantor. Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2001 Indenture, and we would be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded.</p>
<p><em>Governing Law and Judgments</em></p>
<p>The debt securities and the 2001 Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. (Section 11.08)</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="description-of-jpmorgan-chase-financial-company-llcs-callable-fixed-rate-notes-due-june-10-2032-fully-and-unconditionally-guaranteed-by-jpmorgan-chase-co.">DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC’S CALLABLE FIXED RATE NOTES DUE JUNE 10, 2032, FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.</p>
<p>The following description of the Callable Fixed Rate Notes due June 10, 2032 (the “Callable Notes”) is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February 19, 2016 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer (“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorgan Chase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to the Form 10-K. We encourage you to read the 2016 Indenture for additional information.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="general-1">General</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes were outstanding.</p>
<p>The Callable Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. The Callable Notes will rank <em>pari passu</em> with all of the Issuer’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s guarantee of the Callable Notes will rank <em>pari passu</em> with all of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. <strong>Any payment on the Callable Notes issued by JPMorgan Financial is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., as guarantor of the Callable Notes.</strong></p>
<p>The Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A Notes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time. For more information about the Series A Notes, please see the section titled “— General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.</p>
<p>The Callable Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Callable Notes are registered on the books that the Issuer or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in the Callable Notes (registered in street name or otherwise).</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="key-terms-of-the-callable-notes">Key Terms of the Callable Notes</p>
<p>We issued the Callable Notes on June 10, 2021, in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 thereafter. The Maturity Date of the Callable Notes is June 10, 2032. Interest on the Callable Notes is payable semiannually on June 10th and December 10th of each year, beginning on December 10, 2021 to and including the Maturity Date (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), subject to any earlier redemption, at the Interest Rate of 2.60% per annum.</p>
<p>On June 10, 2031 (the “Redemption Date”), the Issuer may redeem the holders’ Callable Notes, in whole but not in part, at a price equal to the principal amount being redeemed <em>plus</em> any accrued and unpaid interest. Any accrued and unpaid interest on the Callable Notes redeemed will be paid to the person who is the holder of record on such Callable Notes at the close of business one (1) business day prior to the Redemption Date. To redeem the Callable Notes, the Issuer will deliver notice to DTC, as holder of the Callable Notes, at least 5 business days and not more than 15 business days prior to the Redemption Date.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="calculation-agent">Calculation Agent</p>
<p>JPMS (the “Calculation Agent”) will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Callable Notes, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Callable Notes.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="payment-upon-an-event-of-default-1">Payment upon an Event of Default</p>
<p>In case an event of default with respect to the Callable Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per $1,000 principal amount note upon any acceleration of the Callable Notes will be determined by the Calculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount note <em>plus</em> accrued and unpaid interest, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date. In such case, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days in such adjusted Interest Period and will be based on the Interest Rate on the applicable date immediately preceding such adjusted Interest Period.</p>
<p>If the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will cause the Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC of the cash amount due with respect to the Callable Notes as promptly as possible and in no event later than two business days after the date of acceleration.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="listing-2">Listing</p>
<p>The Callable Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol “JPM/32.” No assurance can be given as to the continued listing for the term of the Callable Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the Callable Notes.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="book-entry-only-issuance-the-depository-trust-company-1">Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company</p>
<p>DTC will act as securities depositary for the Callable Notes. The Callable Notes have been issued only as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co. (DTC’s nominee). One or more fully registered global note certificates, representing the total aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes, have been issued and have been deposited with DTC. We will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="registrar-transfer-agent-and-paying-agent-1">Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent</p>
<p>The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Callable Notes. The Bank of New York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Callable Notes and may designate additional paying agents.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="reopening-issuances">Reopening Issuances</p>
<p>The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, “reopen” the Callable Notes based upon market conditions at that time. These further issuances, if any, will be consolidated with, have the same CUSIP number as and trade interchangeably with the respective originally issued Callable Notes immediately upon settlement and, consequently, will increase the aggregate principal amount of such outstanding Callable Notes. The price of any additional offering will be determined at the time of pricing of that offering.</p>
<p class="heading unnumbered" id="general-terms-of-the-series-a-notes">General Terms of the Series A Notes</p>
<p>In this “General Terms of the Series A Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series A Notes issued by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC.</p>
<p>The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, including the Callable Notes.</p>
<p>We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued under the 2016 Indenture.</p>
<p>These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2016 Indenture, which describes completely the terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it. Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture. Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.</p>
<p>The debt securities will be the Issuer’s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.</p>
<p>The Guarantor is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a result, claims of the holders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries, except to the extent that the Guarantor may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries. Claims of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ creditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.</p>
<p><em>Events of Default and Waivers</em></p>
<p>An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 Indenture as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;</p></li>
<li><p>default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;</p></li>
<li><p>default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in the 2016 Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written notice has been</p></li>
</ol>
<p>given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee;</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>certain events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary;</p></li>
<li><p>the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, <em>provided</em> that no Event of Default with respect to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a receiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation; or</p></li>
<li><p>any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security. (Section 5.01)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the Issuer, the guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. If a default due to specified events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable. Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)</p>
<p>Events of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities. In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.</p>
<p>Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the debt securities to be declared due and payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor. Instead, even if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the Trustee and the holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and payable unless there is an Event of Default with respect to that series as described above, such as the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation or a payment default by the Issuer or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities. <strong>The value holders receive on any series of debt securities may be significantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the Issuer’s debt securities been declared due and payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.</strong></p>
<p>An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The 2016 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so. The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)</p>
<p>The 2016 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2016 Indenture. (Section 5.09) The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2016 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))</p>
<p>No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25%</p>
<p>in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)</p>
<p>However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)</p>
<p>The 2016 Indenture requires the Issuer and the Guarantor to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05)</p>
<p><em>Modification of the 2016 Indenture</em></p>
<p>The 2016 Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the 2016 Indenture or the rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification. Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2016 Indenture applicable to debt securities in foreign currencies;</p></li>
<li><p>change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification; or</p></li>
<li><p>make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of the debt securities of such series or release the Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Indenture. (Section 8.02)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The 2016 Indenture also permits the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to amend the 2016 Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s merger or the replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2016 Indenture or the Issuer’s debt securities that the Issuer deems necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. (Section 8.01)</p>
<p><em>Consolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets</em></p>
<p>Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all of their respective assets to any other entity, unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>with respect to the Issuer:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>either the Issuer is the continuing company in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor entity in the case of a merger or consolidation (including an affiliate of the Guarantor) or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the Issuer, and</p></li>
<li><p>no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer, and</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>with respect to the Guarantor:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>either the Guarantor is the continuing corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation that expressly assumes the full and unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the Guarantor, and</p></li>
<li><p>no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer. (Sections 9.01 and 9.02)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any transfer of material assets of the Guarantor to any other entity that occurs as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, any proceedings relative to the Guarantor under Title 11 of the United States Code or under a receivership under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or under any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law will be deemed to be a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets.</p>
<p>There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2016 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor, a change of control of the Issuer or the Guarantor or a highly leveraged transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor. The merger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of the Issuer or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s assets. However, the Issuer may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which the Issuer would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.</p>
<p><em>JPMorgan Chase Guarantee</em></p>
<p>The Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all other amounts payable under the debt securities when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption, repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable debt securities or upon acceleration. If for any reason the Issuer does not make any required payment in respect of the Issuer’s debt securities when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by the Issuer under the 2016 Indenture. The guarantee is of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01)</p>
<p>The Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for any amount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by the Issuer, and (2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely from, or on account of, the Issuer’s insolvency or the Issuer’s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to the Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer. (Section 14.02)</p>
<p><em>Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent</em></p>
<p>We, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 Indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, and the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Chase’s indenture. Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2016 Indenture, and the Issuer would be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving the Issuer default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded.</p>
<p><em>Governing Law and Judgments</em></p>
<p>The debt securities and the 2016 Indenture, including the guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. (Section 11.08)</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="jpmorgan-chase-co.-long-term-incentive-plan-terms-and-conditions-of-january-17-2023-restricted-stock-unit-award"><br />
JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF JANUARY 17, 2023 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD</h2>
<p><strong>OPERATING COMMITTEE</strong></p>
<p>These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of January 17, 2023 (“Grant Date”) awarding Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern. The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.</p>
<p>This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement. <strong>Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.</strong> If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in “<u>Definitions</u>” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the Plan.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase” and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="form-and-purpose-of-award">Form and Purpose of Award</h5>
<p>Each RSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date as set forth in your Award Agreement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to motivate your future performance for services to be provided during the vesting period and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="dividend-equivalents">Dividend Equivalents</h5>
<p>If dividends are paid on Common Stock while RSUs under this award are outstanding, you will be paid an amount equal to the dividend paid on one share of Common Stock, multiplied by the number of RSUs outstanding under this award as of the dividend record date.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="vesting-period">Vesting Period</h5>
<p>The period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” pursuant to which the Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="protection-based-vesting">Protection-Based Vesting</h5>
<p>This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”. However, vesting and the number of RSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “<u>Remedies</u>” and the following protection-based vesting provision).</p>
<p>Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk RSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time. Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.</p></li>
<li><p>For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm</p></li>
</ul>
<p>level is negative.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk RSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”.</p>
<p>Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”). In the case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="bonus-recoupment">Bonus Recoupment</h5>
<p>In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy) as in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 2022 and to this award. You can access this policy as currently in effect by clicking the following link to the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Corporate Governance Principles web page and scrolling to the Bonus Recoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters”: https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms and conditions in any way limits the rights of the Firm under the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="termination-of-employment">Termination of Employment</h5>
<p>Except as explicitly set forth below under the subsections captioned “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability” or under the section captioned “<u>Death</u>”, any RSUs outstanding under this award will be cancelled effective on the date your employment with the Firm terminates for any reason.</p>
<p>Subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus</u> <u>Recoupment</u>”, “<u>Your Obligations</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”), you will be eligible to continue to vest (as you otherwise would vest if you were still employed by JPMorgan Chase) with respect to your award in accordance with its terms and conditions following the termination of your employment if one of the following circumstances applies to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Job Elimination</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Firm terminated your employment because your job was eliminated, <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p>after you are notified that your job will be eliminated, you provided such services as requested by the Firm in a cooperative and professional manner, <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p><u>you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.</u></p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>the sum of your age and Recognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination equaled or exceeded 60 <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p>you provided at least 180 days advance written notice to the Firm of your intention to voluntarily terminate your employment under this provision, during which notice period you provided such services as requested by the Firm in a cooperative and professional manner and you did not perform any services for any other employer, <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p>continued vesting shall be appropriate, which determination shall be made prior to your termination and will be based on your performance and conduct (before and after providing notice), <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p>for 36 months from the date of grant of this award you do not either perform services in any capacity (such as an employee, contractor, consultant, advisor, or self-employed individual, whether paid or unpaid) for a Financial Services Company (as defined below) or work in your profession (whether or not for a Financial Services Company); provided that you may work for a government, education or Not-for-Profit Organization (as defined below), <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p>you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After receipt of such advance written notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during such 180-day period as a condition to continued vesting or shorten the length of the 180-day period at the Firm’s sole discretion, but to a date</p>
<p>no earlier than the date you would otherwise meet the age and service requirements.</p>
<p>Additional advance notice requirements may apply for employees subject to notice period policies (see “Notice Period” below).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Government Office</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm to accept a Government Office or become a candidate for an elective Government Office, as described at the end of these terms and conditions under the section captioned “<u>Government Office Requirements</u>”. See also definition of Government Office in the section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Disability</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>your employment with the Firm terminates because (i) you are unable to return to work while you are receiving benefits under the JPMorgan Chase Long Term Disability Plan, or for non-U.S. employees, under the equivalent JPMorgan Chase sponsored local country plan (in either case, “LTD Plan”), or (ii) if you are not covered by a LTD Plan, you are unable to return to work due to a long-term disability that would qualify for benefits under the applicable LTD Plan, as determined by the Firm or a third-party designated by the Firm; provided that you (x) request in writing continued vesting due to such disability within 30 days of the date your employment terminates, and (y) provide any requested supporting documentation and (z) receive the Firm’s written consent to such treatment, <u>and</u></p></li>
<li><p>you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="releasecertification">Release/Certification</h5>
<p>To qualify for continued vesting after termination of your employment under any of the foregoing circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you must timely execute and deliver a release of claims in favor of the Firm, having such form and terms as the Firm shall specify,</p></li>
<li><p>with respect to “Full Career Eligibility”, prior to the termination of your employment, you must confirm with management that you meet the eligibility criteria (including providing at least 180 days advance written notification), advise that you are seeking to be treated as an individual eligible for “Full Career Eligibility”, and receive written consent to such continued vesting,</p></li>
<li><p>with respect to “Full Career Eligibility” and “Government Office”, it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to certify to the Firm prior to each vesting date while the employment restrictions are outstanding, on the authorized form of the Firm, that you have complied with the employment restrictions applicable to you (as described herein) from your date of termination of employment through the applicable vesting date,</p></li>
<li><p>with respect to “Disability”, you must satisfy the notice and documentation described above and receive written consent to such continued vesting, and</p></li>
<li><p>in all cases, complied with all other terms of the Award Agreement. (See section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="death">Death</h5>
<p>If you die while you are eligible to vest in RSUs under this award, the RSUs will immediately vest and will be distributed in shares of Common Stock (after applicable tax withholding) to your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock Administration Department, or if no beneficiary has been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not recognized locally, then to your estate unless otherwise required by local legislation. Any shares will be distributed no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death; however, our administrative practice is to register such shares in the name of your beneficiary or estate within 60 days of the Firm’s receipt of any required documentation.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="your-obligations">Your Obligations</h5>
<p>In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree to comply with and be bound by the obligations set forth below next to the subsections captioned “--Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers”, “--Confidential Information”, “--Non-Disparagement”, ”-- Cooperation”, “--Compliance with Award Agreement” and “--Notice Period.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written consent of the Director of Human Resources: (i) solicit, induce or encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has received official, written notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (ii) hire any employee or former employee who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated for more than six months, (iii) to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or</p>
<p>other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or other persons or entities. This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.</p>
<p>These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Confidential Information</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly (i) use or disclose to anyone any confidential information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i) or (ii), except as explicitly permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. In addition, following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means. “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a regulator, a self- regulatory agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation. It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Non-Disparagement</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group. This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or regulatory investigation or proceeding.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Cooperation</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any audit, tax proceeding, litigation, investigation or governmental proceeding) with respect to which you may have knowledge or information, subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Compliance with Award Agreement</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Notice Period</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.</p>
<p>After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period. During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates. You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the length of the Notice Period.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="remedies">Remedies</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus</u></p>
<p><u>Recoupment</u>”, and “<u>Termination of Employment</u>”, up to 100% of your outstanding RSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible for the inaccuracy, or</p></li>
<li><p>this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or</p></li>
<li><p>you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>” below) or, in the case of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your termination of employment, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “<u>Release/Certification</u>” by the specified deadline, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied. JPMorgan Chase is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Recovery</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment, or</p></li>
<li><p>you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”, or</p></li>
<li><p>you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility” or “--Government Office” following the termination of your employment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of- recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the detrimental and risk- related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection. Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records. For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of- recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes. However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund or other benefit). Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.</p>
<p>Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash. You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.</p>
<p>Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Right to an Injunction</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="administrative-provisions">Administrative Provisions</h5>
<p><strong><u>Withholding Taxes</u>:</strong> As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares, dividend equivalents and the award. This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award, shares that vest under this award, and/or dividend equivalents, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award or dividend equivalents until you pay any taxes associated with the award, vested shares and/or the dividend equivalents directly to the competent authorities.</p>
<p><strong><u>Right to Set Off:</u></strong> Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent. This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.</p>
<p><strong><u>No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations</u>:</strong> RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights. No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested. Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock. By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award. You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based</u> <u>Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>”, “<u>Termination of Employment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)</p>
<p>With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock. By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above). (See Sections captioned “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Binding Agreement</u>:</strong> The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong><u>Not a Contract of Employment</u>:</strong> Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment. Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time. This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining severance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Section 409A Compliance</u>:</strong> To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares and cash hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your</p>
<p>separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service. Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following (i) each applicable vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award and (ii) each date that JPMorgan Chase specifies for payment of dividends declared on its Common Stock, shall be the payment date(s) for purposes of distributing dividend equivalent payments.</p>
<p><strong><u>Change in Outstanding Shares</u>:</strong> In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and to any RSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.</p>
<p><strong><u>Interpretation/Administration</u>:</strong> The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including,</p>
<p>without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions;</p>
<p>(iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate. Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform. By way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.</p>
<p><strong><u>Amendment</u>:</strong> The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is applicable to you. This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p><strong><u>Severability</u>:</strong> If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<p><strong><u>Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity</u>:</strong> Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase RSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before the required divestiture date; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above. The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.</p>
<p>If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “<u>Government Office</u> <u>Requirements</u>”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each applicable vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “<u>Remedies</u>” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>” and “<u>Government Office</u> <u>Requirements</u>” and the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility”.</p>

In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.</p>
<p><strong><u>Non-transferability</u>:</strong> Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of RSUs, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.

<p><strong>OPERATING COMMITTEE</strong></p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="award-agreement">Award Agreement</h5>
<p>These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of January 17, 2023 (“Grant Date”) awarding Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern. The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.</p>
<p>This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement. <strong>Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.</strong> If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in “<u>Definitions</u>” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the Plan.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase” and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="form-and-purpose-of-award-1">Form and Purpose of Award</h5>
<p>Each RSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date as set forth in your Award Agreement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to motivate your future performance for services to be provided during the vesting period and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="dividend-equivalents-1">Dividend Equivalents</h5>
<p>This award is not eligible for dividend equivalent payments.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="vesting-period-1">Vesting Period</h5>
<p>The period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” pursuant to which the Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="protection-based-vesting-1">Protection-Based Vesting</h5>
<p>This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”. However, vesting and the number of RSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “<u>Remedies</u>” and the following protection-based vesting provision).</p>
<p>Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk RSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time. Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are net income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.</p></li>
<li><p>For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk RSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”.</p>
<p>Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).

Such restrictions shall lapse in event of your death.</p>

<li><p>with respect to “Full Career Eligibility” and “Government Office”, it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to certify to the Firm prior to each vesting date while the employment restrictions are outstanding, on the authorized form of the Firm, that you have complied with the employment restrictions applicable to you (as described herein) from your date of termination of employment through the applicable vesting date,</p></li>

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="death-1">Death</h5>
<p>If you die while you are eligible to vest in RSUs under this award, the RSUs will immediately vest and will be distributed in shares of Common Stock (after applicable tax withholding) to your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock Administration Department, or if no beneficiary has been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not recognized locally, then to</p>
<p>your estate unless otherwise required by local legislation. Any shares will be distributed no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death; however, our administrative practice is to register such shares in the name of your beneficiary or estate within 60 days of the Firm’s receipt of any required documentation.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="your-obligations-1">Your Obligations</h5>
<p>In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree to comply with and be bound by the obligations set forth below next to the subsections captioned “--Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers”, “--Confidential Information”, “--Non-Disparagement”, ”-- Cooperation”, “--Compliance with Award Agreement” and “--Notice Period.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment or, (ii) if your award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written consent of the Director of Human Resources: (i) solicit, induce or encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has received official, written notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (ii) hire any employee or former employee who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated for more than six months, (iii) to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or other persons or entities. This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.</p>
<p>These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Confidential Information</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly (i) use or disclose to anyone any confidential information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i) or (ii), except as explicitly permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. In addition, following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means. “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a regulator, a self- regulatory agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation. It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Non-Disparagement</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group. This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or regulatory investigation or proceeding.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Cooperation</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any audit, tax proceeding, litigation, investigation or governmental proceeding) with respect to which you may have knowledge or information, subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Compliance with Award Agreement</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Notice Period</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.</p>
<p>After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period. During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates. You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the length of the Notice Period.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="remedies-1">Remedies</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus</u> <u>Recoupment</u>”, “<u>EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff</u>”, and “<u>Termination of Employment</u>”, up to 100% of your outstanding RSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible for the inaccuracy, or</p></li>
<li><p>this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or</p></li>
<li><p>you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>” below) or, in the case of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your termination of employment, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “<u>Release/Certification</u>” by the specified deadline, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied. JPMorgan Chase is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Recovery</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment, or</p></li>
<li><p>you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”, or</p></li>
<li><p>you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility” or “--Government Office” following the termination of your employment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of- recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the detrimental and risk- related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture” subsection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection. Without limiting the</p>
<p>foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records. For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of- recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes. However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund or other benefit). Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.</p>
<p>Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash. You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.</p>
<p>Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>” and “<u>EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy -</u> <u>Identified Staff</u>”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Right to an Injunction</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="administrative-provisions-1">Administrative Provisions</h5>
<p><strong><u>Withholding Taxes</u>:</strong> As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award. This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and/or vested shares directly to the competent authorities.</p>
<p><strong><u>Right to Set Off:</u></strong> Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt owed by you under this award without your consent. This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.</p>
<p><strong><u>No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations</u>:</strong> RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights. No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested. Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock. By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award. You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based</u> <u>Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>”, “<u>EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff</u>”, “<u>Termination of Employment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)</p>
<p>With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock. By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery</p>
<p>provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above). (See Sections captioned “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Binding Agreement</u>:</strong> The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong><u>Not a Contract of Employment</u>:</strong> Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment. Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time. This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining severance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Section 409A Compliance</u>:</strong> To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to you during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service. Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following each applicable vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award.</p>
<p><strong><u>Change in Outstanding Shares</u>:</strong> In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and to any RSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.</p>
<p><strong><u>Interpretation/Administration</u>:</strong> The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions;</p>
<p>(iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate. Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform. By way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.</p>
<p><strong><u>Amendment</u>:</strong> The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is applicable to you. This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p><strong><u>Severability</u>:</strong> If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<p><strong><u>Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity</u>:</strong> Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase RSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before the required divestiture date; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Remedies” section above. The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.</p>
<p>If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “<u>Government Office</u> <u>Requirements</u>”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each applicable vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “<u>Remedies</u>” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>” and “<u>Government Office</u> <u>Requirements</u>” and the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility”.</p>
<p><strong><u>Use of Personal Data</u>:</strong> By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes). Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations. In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled.</p>
<p><strong><u>Governing Law</u>:</strong> This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p>
<p><strong><u>Choice of Forum</u>:</strong> By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion. In the event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan. You waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.</p>
<p><strong><u>Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims</u>:</strong> By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.</p>
<p><strong><u>Litigation</u>:</strong> By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.</p>
<p><strong><u>Non-transferability</u>:</strong> Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of RSUs, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien. An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.</p>
<p><strong><u>Outstanding Awards</u>:</strong> The Administrative provisions set forth above shall apply to any award of RSUs outstanding as of the date hereof, and such awards are hereby amended.</p>

<p>These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of ________________, 20____ (“Grant Date”) awarding performance share units (“PSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern. The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.</p>
<p>This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan. <strong>Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.</strong> If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.</p>

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="form-and-purpose-of-award-2">Form and Purpose of Award</h5>
<p>Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the vesting date as set forth in your Award Agreement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="number-to-vest-on-the-vesting-date">Number to Vest on the Vesting Date</h5>
<p>Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:</p>
<p><strong>Performance calculation</strong>: On the vesting date, you will vest in a number of PSUs derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table. See sections captioned “<u>Calculation of Performance</u> <u>Ranking</u>” and “<u>Definitions</u>”.</p>
<p>You will also vest in additional shares of Common Stock as calculated under the section captioned, “<u>Reinvested</u> <u>Dividend Equivalent</u> <u>Share Units</u>”. Delivery of vested shares to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of the subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="reinvested-dividend-equivalent-share-units">Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units</h5>
<p>If dividends are paid on Common Stock during the Vesting Period while the award is outstanding, you will receive on the vesting date additional units representing shares of Common Stock as calculated in this section. The number, if any, will be based on the dividends that would have been paid during the Vesting Period as of each dividend payment date on the actual number of shares of Common Stock distributable to you resulting from the vesting of the PSUs, if any, and treated as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock on each dividend payment based on the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on each dividend payment date (“Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="holding-requirement-1">Holding Requirement</h5>
<p>As of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you shall be entitled to be issued a number of shares of the Common Stock of JPMorgan Chase equal to the number of PSUs, if any, plus any additional Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, vesting on such date, less the number withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The net number of shares issued to you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for a two-year period commencing as of the vesting date and ending as of the second anniversary of the vesting date. Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two-year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons. See section captioned, “<u>Death</u>” and subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="calculation-of-performance-ranking">Calculation of Performance Ranking</h5>
<p>For purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance Period shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common Equity” (if otherwise applicable), “Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” (including its footnote) and “ROTCE” as set forth in the</p>
<p>“<u>Definitions</u>” section of these terms and conditions. See section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>”. Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth. See section captioned, “<u>Definitions</u>--Performance Table” in the event of a tie. All performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="capital-ratio-performance-threshold">Capital Ratio Performance Threshold</h5>
<p>Unvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below a predetermined threshold of %.</p>
<p>If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="vesting-period-2">Vesting Period</h5>
<p>The period from the Grant Date to the vesting date is the “Vesting Period”.

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="protection-based-vesting-2">Protection-Based Vesting</h5>
<p>This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date, provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”. However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “<u>Number to Vest on Vesting Date</u>”, “<u>Capital Ratio</u> <u>Performance Threshold</u>”, “<u>Remedies</u>” and the following protection-based vesting provision).</p>
<p>Up to a total of fifty percent of your award (including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units) that would otherwise be distributable to you on the vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time. Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are: net income, total net revenue, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.</p></li>
<li><p>For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.</p></li>
<li><p>RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur prior to the end of the Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty percent of the Target Award Number.</p>
<p>In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, “Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply.</p>
<p>Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”). In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.</p>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus</u> <u>Recoupment</u>” and “<u>Termination of Employment</u>”, up to 100% of your award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) your outstanding PSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:</p>

<li><p>you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>” below) or, in the case of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your termination of employment, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “<u>Release/Certification</u>” by the specified deadline, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied. The Firm is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also “<u>Administrative Provisions</u>—No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.</p>
<p>In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment;</p></li>
<li><p>you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>;” or</p></li>
<li><p>you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government Office” following the termination of your employment.</p></li>

<li><p>In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of- recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate pursuant to the provisions in the section captioned “<u>Recapture Provisions</u>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection. Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records. For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes. However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund or other benefit). Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.</p>
<p>Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash. You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.</p>
<p>Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>”.</p>
<h5 id="right-to-an-injunction"><u>Right to an Injunction</u></h5>
<p>You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="administrative-provisions-2">Administrative Provisions</h5>
<p><strong>Withholding Taxes:</strong> As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the</p>
<p>vested shares and the award. This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Set Off:</strong> Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent. This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.</p>
<p><strong>No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations</strong>: PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights. No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if any, and have vested. Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock. By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award. You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>”, “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>”, “<u>Termination of Employment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)</p>
<p>With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock. By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above). (See sections captioned “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”.)</p>
<p><strong>Binding Agreement</strong>: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Contract of Employment</strong>: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment. Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time. This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining severance.</p>
<p><strong>Section 409A Compliance</strong>: To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service. Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Outstanding Shares</strong>: In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.</p>
<p><strong>Other Equitable Adjustments:</strong> The Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation/Administration</strong>: The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions;</p>
<p>(iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate. Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform. By way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Amendment</strong>: The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is applicable to you. This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong>: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity</strong>: Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, including Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, effective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “<u>Remedies</u>” section above. The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.</p>
<p>If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “<u>Government Office</u> <u>Requirements</u>”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned “<u>Death</u>”.</p>
<p>To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture requirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of the vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “<u>Remedies</u>” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>” and “<u>Government Office Requirements</u>” and the subsection “Full Career Eligibility”.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Personal Data:</strong> By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes). Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to</p>
<p>terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations. In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law</strong>: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Forum</strong>: By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion. In the event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan. You waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.</p>
<p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:</strong> By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.</p>
<p><strong>Litigation:</strong> By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.</p>
<p><strong>Non-transferability:</strong> Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance based share units, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien. An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.</p>

Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern. The Award Agreement, the Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.</p>
<p>This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan. <strong>Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.</strong> If you decline the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in “<u>Definitions</u>” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the Plan.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="form-and-purpose-of-award-3">Form and Purpose of Award</h5>
<p>Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock following each vesting date as set forth in your Award Agreement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its shareholders.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="number-of-performance-share-units-at-end-of-performance-period">Number of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period</h5>
<p>Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:</p>
<p><strong>Performance calculation:</strong> The number of PSUs at the end of the Performance Period will be derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.</p>
<p>The number of PSUs determined above will be subject to the Qualitative Performance Factor (as detailed below), which if the Committee determines that such an adjustment is appropriate, will be applied following the end of each year during the Performance Period, to adjust downward one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each calendar year in the Performance Period. Additionally, the Committee, in its discretion, may make a qualitative performance assessment based on the entire three-year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined above.</p>
<p>See sections captioned “<u>Calculation of Performance Ranking</u>” and “<u>Definitions</u>”.</p>
<p>Delivery of vested shares of common stock to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of the subsection captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="reinvested-dividend-equivalent-share-units-1">Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units</h5>
<p>This award is not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent share units.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="holding-requirement-2">Holding Requirement</h5>
<p>The net number of shares of Common Stock (after tax and all other lawful withholdings) in which you have vested, if any, as of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement will be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for (i) a twelve month period measured from each vesting date; and (ii) a two year period for such shares vesting on ____________, 20 , with the holding periods running concurrently.</p>
<p>Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons. See section captioned, “<u>Death</u>” and subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="calculation-of-performance-ranking-1">Calculation of Performance Ranking</h5>
<p>For purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance Period shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common Equity” (if otherwise applicable), “Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” (including its footnote) and “ROTCE” as set forth in the “<u>Definitions</u>” section of these terms and conditions. See section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>”. Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth. See section captioned, “<u>Definitions</u>--Performance Table” in the event of a tie. All performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="capital-ratio-performance-threshold-1">Capital Ratio Performance Threshold</h5>
<p>Unvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below a predetermined threshold of %.</p>
<p>If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="qualitative-performance">Qualitative Performance</h5>
<p>Determination of Qualitative Performance Factor. Annually during the Performance Period, the Committee will formally assess your qualitative performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls &amp; Conduct; (3) Teamwork &amp; Leadership; and (4) Business Results. If the Committee determines that your performance “Meets” expectations, no downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for that year shall take place (and the Qualitative Performance Factor shall be 100%). If the Committee determines that your performance did “Not Meet” expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what extent. A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0% and 99%, depending on the circumstances. During the Performance Period, a 0% Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period would reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to zero, resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on your performance during the entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined under section captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at End of the Performance Period”. In the case of a Qualitative Performance Factor of 0%, the award would be cancelled.</p>
<p>The assessment will have regard to feedback solicited from the Chair of the UK Remuneration Committee to incorporate qualitative performance against local regulatory responsibilities as a “Senior Manager” of the relevant CIB UK-regulated entities.</p>
<p>The Qualitative Performance Factor shall only be applied, if applicable, in respect of a period of your employment with the Firm, or as soon as administratively practical.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="protection-based-vesting-3">Protection-Based Vesting</h5>
<p>This award is intended and expected to vest on each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”. However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “<u>Number of</u> <u>Performance Share Units at the end of Performance Period</u>”, “<u>Capital Ratio Performance Threshold</u>”, “<u>Recapture Provisions</u>”, “<u>Remedies</u>” and the following protection-based vesting provision).</p>
<p>Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you as of any vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time. Among the factors the CEO may consider in assessing performance are: net income, total net revenue, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.</p></li>
<li><p>For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.</p></li>
<li><p>RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur prior to the end of the Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty percent of the Target Award Number.</p>
<p>In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation circumstances described above will continue to apply.</p>
<p>Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”). In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.</p>

This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.</p>
<p>These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.</p>
<h5 id="confidential-information-1"><u>Confidential Information</u></h5>
<p>You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly (i) use or disclose to anyone any confidential information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i) or (ii), except as explicitly permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process. In addition, following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information through telephonic, intranet or internet means. “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a regulator, a self- regulatory agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct violation. It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a court of law.</p>
<h5 id="non-disparagement-1"><u>Non-Disparagement</u></h5>
<p>You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group.

<h5 id="notice-period-1"><u>Notice Period</u></h5>
<p>If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such contract or policy.</p>
<p>After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period. During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates. You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the length of the Notice Period.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="remedies-3">Remedies</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy – Identified Staff”, “Recapture Provisions” and “Termination of Employment”, up to 100% of your award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) your outstanding PSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any of the following detrimental and risk-related conduct has occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible for the inaccuracy, or</p></li>
<li><p>this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or</p></li>
<li><p>you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or</p></li>
<li><p>your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “<u>Definitions</u>” below) or, in the case of a determination after the termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your termination of employment, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “<u>Release/Certification</u>” by the specified deadline, or</p></li>
<li><p>you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are satisfied. The Firm is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also “<u>Administrative Provisions</u>-No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.</p>
<h5 id="recovery"><u>Recovery</u></h5>
<p>In addition , you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment;</p></li>
<li><p>you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “<u>Your Obligations</u>;” or</p></li>
<li><p>you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government Office” following the termination of your employment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of- recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate as a result of the detrimental and risk- related conduct listed in the above “Detrimental Conduct, Risk Related and Other Cancellation/Recapture” subsection”.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection. Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known address maintained in the Firm’s employment records. For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes. However, it is the Firm’s intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to shares that are or may be retained by you following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including as a tax credit, refund or other benefit). Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.</p>
<p>Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash. You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.</p>
<p>Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>” and “<u>EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy -</u> <u>Identified Staff</u>”.</p>
<h5 id="right-to-an-injunction-1"><u>Right to an Injunction</u></h5>
<p>You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="administrative-provisions-3">Administrative Provisions</h5>
<p><strong>Withholding Taxes:</strong> As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award. This may include but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares directly to the competent authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Set Off:</strong> Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent. This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.</p>
<p><strong>No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations</strong>: PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights. No shares of Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if any, and have vested. Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock. By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award. You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the</p>
<p>period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”, “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>”, “<u>EMEA Malus &amp;</u> <u>Clawback Policy - Identified Staff</u>”, “<u>Termination of Employment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”, as well as the subsection captioned “-- Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)</p>
<p>With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock. By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above). (See sections captioned “<u>Bonus Recoupment</u>” and “<u>Remedies</u>”.)</p>
<p><strong>Binding Agreement</strong>: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Contract of Employment</strong>: Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment. Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time. This award does not confer any right or entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not compensation for purposes of determining severance.</p>
<p><strong>Section 409A Compliance</strong>: To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable (under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service. Further, if your award is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year immediately following each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of the award.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Outstanding Shares</strong>: In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.</p>
<p><strong>Other Equitable Adjustments:</strong> Except for the “Qualitative Performance Factor”, the Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation/Administration</strong>: The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions;</p>
<p>(iv) decide all claims arising with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate. Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform. By way of clarification, the Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Amendment</strong>: The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is applicable to you. This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong>: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity</strong>: Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “<u>Remedies</u>” section above. The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.</p>
<p>If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “<u>Government Office</u> <u>Requirements</u>”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. Subject to the two foregoing sections, the number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned “<u>Death</u>”.</p>
<p>To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture requirement as forth herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “<u>Remedies</u>” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “<u>Protection-Based Vesting</u>” and “<u>Government Office Requirements</u>” and the subsection “Full Career Eligibility”.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Personal Data:</strong> By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes). Additionally, you agree that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations. In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be cancelled.</p>

In the event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan. You waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.</p>
<p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:</strong> By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim</p>
<p>will be brought on an individual basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.</p>
<p><strong>Litigation:</strong> By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.</p>
<p><strong>Non-transferability:</strong> Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance based share units, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.
