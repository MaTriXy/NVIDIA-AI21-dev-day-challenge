Each such notice of a Borrowing (a “<u>Notice of Borrowing</u>”) shall be by e-mail, confirmed promptly in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances constituting such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the currency and initial Interest Period for each such Advance and (v) name of the relevant Borrower (which shall be the Company or a Borrowing Subsidiary).

The Agent is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of the Income because the Agent is a United States Person.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Lender that is a United States Person shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (each, a “<u>Fore</u>ig<u>n Lender</u>”) shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-9 or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as appropriate), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Foreign Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on any Income that is the subject of such forms. If the relevant Borrower determines, based on the form provided by a Foreign Lender (or the failure to provide such a form) at the time such Foreign Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement that a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero applies to payments made by such Borrower to the Foreign Lender under this Agreement, such Borrower shall be permitted to deduct amounts from payments to such Foreign Lender to the extent required to pay withholding tax at such rate, and such amounts shall be considered excluded from Taxes as defined in Section 2.14(c); p <u>rovided, however</u>, that, if on the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Foreign Lender becomes a Foreign Lender, pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption provisions of Article VIII, the Foreign Lender assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.14(c) in respect of United States withholding tax paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to Taxes that are imposed pursuant to a Change in Law (defined below) after the date of Assignment and Assumption) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Foreign Lender assignee on such date. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of any Borrower under Section 2.14 of this Agreement shall not be increased as the result of any assignment pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement with respect to United States withholding tax; p <u>rovided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the foregoing shall not limit the obligation of any Borrower in respect of Taxes imposed as the result of any Change in Law after the date of the relevant Assignment and Assumption.</p></li>

If any Borrower is required to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any Income, then: (i) the sum payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for such Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by the Company pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

<li><p>Each Lender that is a United States Person shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (each, a “<u>Fore</u>ig<u>n Lender</u>”) shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-9 or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as appropriate), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Foreign Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on any Income that is the subject of such forms.

<p>As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company’s intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, if such Borrowing Subsidiary is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Borrowing Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a “<u>Protesting</u> <u>Lender</u>”) shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; p <u>rovided</u> that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee Lender (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a “Borrowing Subsidiary” hereunder.</p>
