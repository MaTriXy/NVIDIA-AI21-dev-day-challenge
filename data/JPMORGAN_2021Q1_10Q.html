<p><em>Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified.</em></p>
<h5 id="firmwide-overview">Firmwide overview</h5>
<p>JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021, or $4.50 per share, on net revenue of $32.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 23% and ROTCE of 29%. The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $5.2 billion compared to an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion in the prior year, as well as a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Net income was $14.3 billion, up $11.4 billion.</p></li>
<li><p>Total net revenue was up 14%. Noninterest revenue was</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$19.4 billion, up 40%, predominantly driven by higher CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in the prior year. Net interest income was $12.9 billion, down 11%, predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue- related expense and continued investments in the businesses. The increase in expense also included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.</p></li>
<li><p>The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $4.2 billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses of $5.2 billion, compared to an expense of $8.3 billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net additions to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion.</p></li>
<li><p>The total allowance for credit losses was $25.6 billion at March 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.42%, compared with 2.95% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and 2.32% in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the allowance for loan losses.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.3 billion at March 31, 2021, an increase of $3.2 billion from the prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, nonperforming assets decreased $649 million from December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil &amp; Gas and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.</p></li>
<li><p>Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%, driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) in CCB and CB.</p></li>
<li><p>Firmwide average deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36%, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></li>
<li><p>As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $697 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $841 billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for additional information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="selected-capital-related-metrics">Selected capital-related metrics</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>The Firm’s CET1 capital was $206 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.1% and 13.7%, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm’s SLR was 6.7%, and without the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, 5.5%.</p></li>

In the U.S., several stimulus packages were enacted including the CARES Act in March of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in March of 2021, which provided funding to support loan facilities to assist consumers and businesses and stimulus payments to individuals.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Investment banking fees</strong> increased across products in CIB, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher equity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO market due to increased industry-wide fees</p></li>
<li><p>higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of completed transactions, in part related to transactions announced in the second half of 2020, and</p></li>
<li><p>higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds and leveraged loans due to increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to CIB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Principal transactions revenue</strong> increased, in part due to the absence of two significant items in the prior year: a</p>
<p>$951 million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments &amp; Other; and an $896 million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB.</p>
<p>Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue increased in CIB driven by strong performance in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Equity Markets across derivatives, Cash Equities, and prime brokerage, and</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed Income Markets particularly in Securitized Products and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies &amp; Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.</p>
<p>Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.</p>
<p>Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 33-34, and Note 5 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Lending- and deposit-related fees</strong> decreased reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower deposit-related fees in CCB given the higher deposits held in existing and new accounts,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>predominantly offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees in CIB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages 23-27 and CB on pages 28-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Asset management, administration and commissions revenue</strong> increased driven by higher asset management fees as a result of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers, in AWM, and to a lesser extent,</p></li>
<li><p>higher levels of investment assets on higher average market levels and net inflows in CCB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 20-22 and pages 30-32, respectively, and Note 5 for information on asset management, administration and commissions revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Investment securities gains</strong> in both periods reflected the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for information on investment securities gains.</p>
<p><strong>Mortgage fees and related income</strong> increased predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production margins and volumes.</p>
<p>Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, Note 5 and 14 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Card income</strong> increased driven by lower acquisition costs, and higher net interchange income in CCB, with debit and credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 and Note 5 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Other income</strong> decreased reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weather-related write-downs on certain renewable energy investments, as well as increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments in the tax-oriented investment portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits</p></li>
<li><p>lower gains on certain Corporate investments, and</p></li>
<li><p>lower operating lease income from a decline in auto operating lease volume in CCB,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>net valuation gains on certain investments, compared with losses in the prior year, in AWM, and</p></li>
<li><p>the absence of losses on certain equity investments in CIB in the prior year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Net interest income</strong> decreased predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth.</p>
<p>The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.1 trillion, up $661 billion, predominantly driven by higher deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield was 1.87%, down 127 basis points (“bps”), primarily due to lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.69%, a decrease of 68 bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.93%, down 108 bps.</p>
<p>Net yield on an FTE basis, and net yield excluding CIB Markets are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 162 for further details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a further discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.</p>

<p>The <strong>provision for credit losses</strong> decreased driven by net reductions in both the consumer and wholesale allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>The decrease in <strong>consumer</strong> was driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $4.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, including $3.5 billion in Card reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and $625 million in Home Lending primarily due to the continued improvement in home price index ("HPI") expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and</p></li>
<li><p>lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment assistance and government stimulus;</p></li>
<li><p>the prior year included a $4.4 billion addition to the allowance for credit losses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The decrease in <strong>wholesale</strong> reflects a net reduction of $716 million in the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios.</p>

<p>(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks</strong> increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in deposits and lower opportunities in Treasury and CIO to deploy funds in securities purchased under resale agreements. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.</p>
<p><strong>Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements</strong> decreased driven by the lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO; and in CIB lower client-driven market-making activities, partially offset by higher demand for securities to cover short positions. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and Note 10 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Securities borrowed</strong> increased driven by client-driven activities in Fixed Income Financing and Equity Markets, and higher demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and Note 10 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Trading assets</strong> increased due to strong client-driven market-making activities in equity instruments in CIB Markets, including prime brokerage. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Investment securities</strong> increased, reflecting net purchases of U.S. Treasuries in the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio predominantly offset by a decrease in the available-for-sale ("AFS") portfolio. The decrease in AFS was due to paydowns and net valuation losses, partially offset by net purchases.</p>
<p>Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 65, and Notes 2 and 9 for additional information on Investment securities.</p>
<p><strong>Loans</strong> were flat as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the reduction in Card due to the impact of seasonality, and higher payment rates; lower loans in CB; and net paydowns in Home Lending</p></li>
</ul>
<p>were offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the origination of PPP loans in CBB and CB; growth in CIB loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, and in AWM securities-based and custom lending, as well as mortgages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>allowance for loan losses</strong> decreased consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and</p></li>
<li><p>an $875 million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There was a $107 million addition to the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The total net reduction to the allowance for credit losses was $5.2 billion, as of March 31, 2021.</p>
<p>Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 47-65, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.</p>
<p><strong>Accrued interest and accounts receivable</strong> increased largely due to higher client receivables related to client- driven activities in CIB prime brokerage.</p>
<h5 id="selected-consolidated-balance-sheets-data-continued">Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued)</h5>
<p><strong>Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles</strong> increased driven by higher MSRs as a result of lower prepayment speeds on higher rates, as well as net additions to the MSRs. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Other assets</strong> increased predominantly due to the impact of securities financing transactions in CIB prime brokerage, as well as higher cash collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCPs"). Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities lending transactions.</p>

<p>(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Deposits</strong> increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as growth from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements</strong> increased reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading assets in CIB, and</p></li>
<li><p>the impact of client activities in CIB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and Note 10 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Short-term borrowings</strong> increased as a result of higher financing of prime brokerage activities, and net issuance of structured notes in CIB, as well as the issuance of commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to pages</p>
<p>42-46 for information on changes in Liquidity Risk Management.</p>
<p><strong>Trading liabilities</strong> increased due to client-driven market- making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Accounts payable and other liabilities</strong> increased largely due to the impact of securities financing transactions in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities lending transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs</strong> decreased driven by lower issuances as a result of lower loan balances in the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Refer to Off- Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 15 and Notes 13 and 22 for further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term debt</strong> was relatively flat as maturities and fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to higher rates were offset by net issuances. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Stockholders’ equity</strong> was relatively flat as net income was offset by the impact of capital actions and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow hedges. Refer to page 82 for information on changes in stockholders’ equity, Capital actions on pages 39-40, and Note 19 for additional information on AOCI.</p>

<h3 id="off-balance-sheet-arrangements"> <u>OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS</u> </h3>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off- balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).</p>
<h2 id="special-purpose-entities">Special-purpose entities</h2>
<p>The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).</p>
<p>The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees.</p>
<p>The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing.</p>
<p>The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.</p>

<h3 id="explanation-and-reconciliation-of-the-firms-use-of-non-gaap-financial-measures"> <u>EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</u> </h3>
<p>The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 79-83.</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment</p>
<p>level. These non-GAAP measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis)</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense</p></li>
<li><p>Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets</p></li>
<li><p>TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS</p></li>
<li><p>Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non- GAAP financial measures.</p>

<h3 id="business-segment-results"> <u>BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS</u> </h3>
<p>The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer &amp; Community Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &amp; Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.</p>
<p>The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a definition of managed basis.</p>
<p><strong>Description of business segment reporting methodology</strong> Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.</p>
<p><em>Revenue sharing</em></p>
<p>When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue- sharing agreements.</p>
<p><em>Capital allocation</em></p>
<p>The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.</p>
<p>Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.</p>
<p>Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.</p>

Quarterly results</h5>
<p>Net income was $6.7 billion, up $6.5 billion, driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.</p>
<p>Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a decrease of 6%.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $7.9 billion, down 14%, driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, lower loans in Card due to the cumulative impact of lower spend throughout 2020 and higher payment rates, and lower loans in Home Lending due to net paydowns,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>growth in deposits in CBB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Noninterest revenue was $4.6 billion, up 12%, driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production margins and volumes, and</p></li>
<li><p>higher card income due to lower acquisition costs and higher net interchange income, with debit and credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower deposit-related fees given the higher deposits held in existing and new accounts, and</p></li>
<li><p>lower auto lease volume.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.</p>
<p>Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, relatively flat, reflecting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>higher investments in the business offset by</p></li>
<li><p>lower structural expenses, and</p></li>
<li><p>lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including lower depreciation on auto lease assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $3.6 billion, compared with an expense of $5.8 billion in the prior year, driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $4.6 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, consisting of $3.5 billion in Card, $625 million in Home Lending, primarily due to the continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, $350 million in CBB and</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$150 million in Auto, and</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lower net charge-offs in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment assistance and government stimulus.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The prior year included a $4.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes select income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are</p>
<p>recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 74 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information.</p>
<p>For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.</p>

<h5 id="quarterly-results-2">Quarterly results</h5>
<p>Net income was $1.2 billion, up $1.0 billion, predominantly driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.</p>
<p>Net revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11%. Net interest income was $1.5 billion, down 5%, driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit balances and lending revenue due to increased portfolio spreads. Noninterest revenue was $917 million, up 51%, predominantly driven by higher investment banking revenue, the absence of prior year markdowns in the bridge financing portfolio, and higher deposit-related fees, particularly cash management fees.</p>
<p>Noninterest expense was $969 million, down 2%, driven by lower structural expense.</p>
<p>The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $118 million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses, compared with an expense of $1.0 billion in the prior year.</p>

<h3 id="firmwide-risk-management"> <u>FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.</p>
<p>The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;</p></li>
<li><p>Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and</p></li>
<li><p>Firmwide structures for risk governance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.</p>
<h5 id="risk-governance-and-oversight-framework">Risk governance and oversight framework</h5>
<p>The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.</p>
<p>Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.</p>

<p>Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.</p>
<p>The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized.</p>
<p>Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and stress testing.</p>
<p><em>Basel III Overview</em></p>
<p>The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies ("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective minimum capital ratios.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk- based ratios.</p>
<p>Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional information.</p>
<p><em>Key Regulatory Developments</em></p>
<p><em>CECL regulatory capital transition delay.</em> As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 (“CECL capital transition provisions”).</p>
<p>The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $4.5 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $7.0 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD loans).</p>
<p>The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance.</p>
<p><em>SLR temporary revision.</em> The Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect through March 31, 2021.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and FDIC issued an interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this exclusion.</p>
<p><em>PPP.</em> On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29, 2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had approximately $32 billion of loans under the program.</p>
<p>Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending (“PPPL”) Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude them under the final rule.</p>
<p><em>TLAC Holdings rule</em>. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss- Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC debt instruments issued by systemically important banking organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.</p>

<p><em>Common stock</em></p>
<p>On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through at least the second quarter of 2021.</p>

<p>On April 5, 2021, the Firm submitted its 2021 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") process. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve will disclose the Firm’s indicative Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") requirement which will become effective October 1, 2021 and summary information regarding the Firm’s stress test results by July 1, 2021. The Firm's SCB is currently 3.3%.</p>
<p>Based on the Federal Reserve's March 25, 2021 announcement, if the Firm remains above all of its minimum risk-based capital requirements based on the 2021 CCAR stress test results, the temporary restrictions on capital distributions currently in effect will expire as planned on June 30, 2021. However, if the Firm falls below any of its minimum risk-based requirements in the 2021 CCAR stress test it will remain subject to the temporary restrictions through at least September 30, 2021.</p>

<h3 id="liquidity-risk-management"> <u>LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.</p>
<p><strong>LCR and HQLA</strong></p>
<p>The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended</p>

<p>The Firm’s average LCR was 110% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with the prior year period primarily due to the relative impact on net cash outflows from a significant increase in deposits.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with both the three month periods ended December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.</p>
<p>The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.</p>
<p><strong>Other liquidity sources</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately</p>
<p>$841 billion and $740 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits.</p>
<p>The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $301 billion and $307 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>NSFR</strong></p>
<p>The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.</p>
<p>The Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based on its current understanding of the final rule.</p>
<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
<h5 id="sources-of-funds">Sources of funds</h5>
<p>Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.</p>
<p>The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long- term secured borrowings, through the issuance of</p>
<h5 id="deposits">Deposits</h5>
<p>unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short- term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.</p>

<p>Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.</p>
<p>The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during</p>
<p>periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.</p>
<p>Average deposits increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as growth from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term funding</strong></p>
<p>The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, reflecting higher secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading assets in CIB, and the impact of client activities in CIB.</p>
<p>The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.</p>
<p>The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The increase in commercial paper at March 31, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.</p>
<h5 id="long-term-funding-and-issuance">Long-term funding and issuance</h5>
<p>Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.</p>
<p>The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.</p>

<h5 id="credit-ratings">Credit ratings</h5>
<p>The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 15, and liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.</p>
<p>The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021, except as noted below, were as follows:</p>

<p>The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered troubled debt restructurings (<em>“</em>TDRs<em>”</em>). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

<p>The Firm continues to participate in the PPP, for which the application deadline was extended to May 31, 2021. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had approximately $32 billion and $27 billion of loans under the PPP, respectively, including $23 billion and $19 billion in the consumer portfolio, and $9 billion and $8 billion in the wholesale portfolio. The impact on interest income related to PPP loans was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2021.</p>
<p>When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness amount from the SBA. The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications and through March 31, 2021, approximately $7 billion of loans were forgiven.</p>

<h3 id="consumer-credit-portfolio"> <u>CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO</u> </h3>
<p>The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and business banking loans, as well as associated lending- related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic environment continued to improve. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, benefited from government stimulus programs, payment deferrals and increasing home prices. The Firm may obtain</p>
<p>credit protection against certain pools of loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit linked notes. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-120 and Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on lending-related commitments.</p>

<p>In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had $9.3 billion of retained loans under payment deferral programs, which represented a decrease of approximately $1.5 billion from December 31, 2020, $3.0 billion from September 30, 2020 and $19.0 billion from June 30, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, there were approximately $886 million of new enrollments</p>
<p>in payment deferral programs predominantly in residential real estate and credit card. Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.</p>

<p>Of the $9.3 billion of loans still under payment deferral programs as of March 31, 2021, approximately $3.9 billion were accounted for as TDRs, either because they were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect the option to suspend TDR accounting guidance provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.</p>
<p>Predominantly all borrowers, including those with loans accounted for as TDRs, were current upon enrollment in payment deferral programs and are expected to exit payment deferral programs in a current status, either because no payments are contractually due during the deferral period or because payments originally contractually due during the deferral period will be due at maturity upon exit. For those borrowers that are unable to resume making payments in accordance with the original or modified contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from deferral programs, they will be placed on nonaccrual status in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and charged off</p>
<p>or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge- off policies.</p>

<h5 id="portfolio-analysis">Portfolio analysis</h5>
<p>Loan balances increased from December 31, 2020 driven by higher loans in auto and other reflecting PPP loan originations, partially offset by lower residential real estate loans.</p>
<p><strong>Residential real estate:</strong> The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.</p>
<p>The retained loan portfolio declined from December 31, 2020 due to paydowns predominantly in Home Lending which were largely offset by originations of prime mortgage loans in Home Lending and AWM. Retained nonaccrual loans were relatively flat from December 31, 2020. Net recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were lower when compared with the same period in the prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale in Home Lending.</p>
<p>The loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value portfolio increased from December 31, 2020 largely driven by warehouse loans in Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to sales in CIB.</p>
<p>The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $22.2 billion at March 31, 2021. This amount included $8.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $7.3 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material</p>

<p>The following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer to Note 11 for further information on modifications for the three months ended and March 31, 2021 and 2020.</p>
<p>$25.9 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher- balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were consistent with the broader residential mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is generally in line with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio.</p>

<li><p>At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $3.0 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Auto and other:</strong> The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared with December 31, 2020 due to PPP loan originations net of forgiveness in Business Banking as well as from growth in the auto portfolio from loan originations, largely offset by paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.13% and 0.41% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Auto charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 benefited from government stimulus, payment assistance programs, and high vehicle collateral values.</p>

<h2 id="credit-card">Credit card</h2>
<p>Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2020 reflecting the impact of seasonality as well as higher payment rates. The March 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.40% and 0.80%, respectively, decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and</p>
<p>90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%, respectively. The delinquency rates were positively impacted by borrowers who received payment assistance and government stimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with the same period in the prior year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment assistance and government stimulus.</p>
<p>Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies.</p>

<h3 id="wholesale-credit-portfolio"> <u>WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO</u> </h3>
<p>In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 55-59 for further information.</p>
<p>The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB including business banking and auto dealer for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic environment continued to improve following the broad- based credit deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2021, retained loans remained relatively flat while lending related commitments increased $31.4 billion from December 31, 2020 to $481.2 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.</p>
<p>In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the investment- grade percentage of the credit portfolio decreased from 71% to 69% driven by net portfolio activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure increased $5.3 billion from $41.6 billion at December 31, 2020 to $46.9 billion at March 31, 2021, driven by select downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades.</p>
<p>Nonperforming exposure was relatively flat at $4.9 billion and net charge off activity was $53 million.</p>

<p>In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.</p>

Predominantly all clients that</p>
<p>exited deferral are current or have paid down their loans, and the Firm has not experienced significant new payment deferral requests. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.</p>

<p>In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.</p>
<h5 id="wholesale-credit-exposure-maturity-and-ratings-profile">Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile</h5>
<p>The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.</p>

<p>The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.</p>
<p>Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held- for-sale and loans at fair value, was $46.9 billion at</p>
<p>March 31, 2021, compared with $41.6 billion at</p>
<p>December 31, 2020, representing approximately 4.4% and 4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The increase in total criticized exposure was driven by select downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades . The total criticized exposure was largely undrawn and $42.8 billion was performing.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

<p>The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Since March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loan exposure increased $1.5 billion, driven by downgrades across multiple industries on client credit deterioration, with the largest concentration in Real Estate, predominantly within Retail and Lodging. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $390 million, when compared to December 31, 2020 driven by net portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil &amp; Gas and Individuals.</p>

<h5 id="lending-related-commitments">Lending-related commitments</h5>
<p>The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.</p>
<p>The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments.</p>
<h5 id="receivables-from-customers">Receivables from customers</h5>
<p>Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<h5 id="derivative-contracts">Derivative contracts</h5>
<p>Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage</p>
<p>The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily</p>
<p>— was approximately 88% at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.</p>
<p>The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $73.1 billion and $79.6 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables for the counterparty. The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.</p>

<h3 id="allowance-for-credit-losses"> <u>ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES</u> </h3>
<p>The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,</p></li>
<li><p>the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and</p></li>
<li><p>the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Discussion of changes in the allowance</em></p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and</p></li>
<li><p>a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Further, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross</p>
<p>domestic product ("GDP") returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.</p>
<p>The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:</p>

<h3 id="investment-portfolio-risk-management"> <u>INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held non-traded financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.</p>
<h5 id="investment-securities-risk">Investment securities risk</h5>
<p>Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $595.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.</p>
<p>Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 66-70 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for further information on related liquidity risk.</p>
<h5 id="principal-investment-risk"><br />
Principal investment risk</h5>
<p>Principal investments are typically privately held non- traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios have not been significantly affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainties remain that could result in future negative impacts.</p>
<p>The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.</p>

<h3 id="market-risk-management"> <u>MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk.</p>
<p>Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.</p>
<p>Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur, such as those observed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 73.</p>
<p>Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time.</p>
<h5 id="value-at-risk"><br />
Value-at-risk</h5>
<p>JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.</p>
<p>The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.</p>
<p>The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals.</p>
<p>Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm.</p>
<p>The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.</p>

<p>Average total VaR increased by $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 when compared with the prior quarter driven by increases in exposure in fixed income, partially offset by volatility which occurred in late March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period.</p>
<h5 id="year-over-year-results">Year over year results</h5>
<p>Average total VaR increased by $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and predominantly impacted exposure in fixed income, as well as increases from Corporate VaR due to the inclusion of a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by risk reductions in equities.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total VaR and each of the components would have been higher by the amounts reported in the following table:</p>

<p>The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.</p>
<p>For the 12 months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 165 of the 259 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 47 of the 63 days, and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.</p>
<p>The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended March 31, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day.</p>
<p>Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.</p>

<p><strong>Earnings-at-risk</strong></p>
<p>The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.</p>
<p>One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience.</p></li>
<li><p>The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information).</p>
<p>The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.</p>

<p>The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of</p>
<p>March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits.</p>
<p>Based upon current and implied market rates as of March 31, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While</p>
<p>the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings- at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income. In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require additional management judgment and therefore, the actual outcomes may differ from these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="country-risk-management"> <u>COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.</p>
<p>Given the remaining uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact to individual countries.</p>
<p>Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management.</p>

<p>The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2021 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.</p>
<p>The increase in exposure to Australia was predominantly due to increased cash placements with the central bank of Australia, driven by client activity following recent policy decisions in the country and growth in client deposits.</p>

<h3 id="operational-risk-management"> <u>OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Operational Risk Management.</p>
<p><strong>Subcategories and examples of operational risks</strong> Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for more information. Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided below.</p>
<p><em>Business and technology resiliency risk</em></p>
<p>Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption. The program includes governance, awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and after various events.</p>
<p><em>Cybersecurity Risk</em></p>
<p>Due to the on-going impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues to leverage use of remote access and also video conferencing solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote work. As a result, the Firm deployed additional precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p><em>Payment Fraud Risk</em></p>
<p>The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level across the industry, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams involving the pandemic, including an increase in the level of fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators continue to evolve. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings.</p>
<h3 id="estimations-and-model-risk-management"> <u>ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT</u> </h3>
<p>Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.</p>
<p>The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment- based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, and making business decisions.</p>
<p>While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical macroeconomic environments upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods.</p>
<p>Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 74-76 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.</p>
<h3 id="critical-accounting-estimates-used-by-the-firm"> <u>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM</u> </h3>
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.</p>
<h5 id="allowance-for-credit-losses-1">Allowance for credit losses</h5>
<p>The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),</p></li>
<li><p>The allowance for lending-related commitments, and</p></li>
<li><p>The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63–64 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.</p>
<p>One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest</p>
<p>effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.</p></li>
<li><p>Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that affected borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors.</p>
<p>Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.</p>
<p>To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.</p>
<p>For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 2.4% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021; lower</p>
<p>U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining 2.6% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of nearly 6.6% in the third quarter of 2021; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of 17.4% and a trough in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario</p></li>
<li><p>the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables</p></li>
<li><p>the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not seen in recent history, which continues to add higher degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss estimations</p></li>
<li><p>significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, effects of government support and customer assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described below.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2021, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison between these two scenarios reflects the following differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An increase of approximately $700 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2021.</p>
<h5 id="fair-value">Fair value</h5>
<p>JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.</p>
<p><em>Assets measured at fair value</em></p>
<p>The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.</p>

<p>This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.</p>
<p>Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its</p>
<p>value<sup>(a)</sup> 1.3%</p>
<p>(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.9 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.</p>
<p><em>Valuation</em></p>
<p>Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.</p>
<p>For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.</p>
<p>Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.</p>
<p>The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.</p>
<h5 id="goodwill-impairment"><br />
Goodwill impairment</h5>
<p>Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2021.</p>
<h5 id="credit-card-rewards-liability">Credit card rewards liability</h5>
<p>The credit card rewards liability was $8.0 billion and $7.7 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.</p>
<h5 id="income-taxes">Income taxes</h5>

<li><p>Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met.</p></li>
<li><p>The January 2021 update provides an election to account for derivatives modified to change the rate used for discounting, margining, or contract price alignment (collectively “discounting transition”) as modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 2021 update was effective when issued.</p></li>
<li><p>The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships, and discounting transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting transition election was applied retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.</p></li>

<h5 id="notes-to-consolidated-financial-statements-unaudited">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)</h5>
<h2 id="note-1-basis-of-presentation">Note 1 – Basis of presentation</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.</p>
<p>The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated.</p>
<p>These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis.</p>
<h5 id="consolidation"><br />
Consolidation</h5>
<p>The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.</p>
<p>Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation.</p>
<h5 id="offsetting-assets-and-liabilities">Offsetting assets and liabilities</h5>
<p>U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.</p>
<h2 id="note-2-fair-value-measurement">Note 2 – Fair value measurement</h2>
<p>Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy.</p>
<p>The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.</p>

<li><p>Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value.

<h5 id="level-3-valuations">Level 3 valuations</h5>
<p>Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.</p>
<p>The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.</p>
<p>In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.</p>

<p>Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements</strong> The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair</p>
<p>value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.</p>

<p>Level 3 assets at fair value, including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were 0.5% of total Firm assets at March 31, 2021. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2020, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 94 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.</p>
<p><em>Three months ended March 31, 2021</em></p>
<p>Level 3 assets were $17.4 billion at March 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of $952 million from December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was predominantly driven by a $1.2 billion increase in MSRs. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.</p>

<p>For the three months ended March 31, 2020, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$2.1 billion of total debt and equity instruments, predominantly trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability.</p></li>
<li><p>$1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$1.7 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs.</p>
<p>For the three months ended March 31, 2020, there were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.</p>
<p>All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/ or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.</p>
<p><em>Gains and losses</em></p>
<p>The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated.

<p>In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.</p>
<p>The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes.

<li><p>Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.</p></li>

<p>The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice.

<h2 id="note-3-fair-value-option">Note 3 – Fair value option</h2>
<p>The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.</p>
<p>The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.</p>
<p>The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments</p></li>
<li><p>Certain securities financing agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument</p></li>
<li><p>Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are issued as part of client-driven activities</p></li>
<li><p>Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value</p></li>

<p>JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.</p>
<p>The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge</p>
<p>accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.</p>

<p>In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:</p>

<p>The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.</p>

<p><em>Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset</em></p>
<p>In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP.

<p>Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.</p>

<p>The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $3.6 billion and $150 million, at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.</p>

<li><p>Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.</p></li>
<li><p>Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.</p></li>

<p>Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances</p>
<p>outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.</p>

<h5 id="transfers-not-qualifying-for-sale-accounting">Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting</h5>
<p>At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Firm held $603 million and $598 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<h2 id="note-11-loans">Note 11 – Loans</h2>
<h5 id="loan-accounting-framework">Loan accounting framework</h5>
<p>The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)</p></li>
<li><p>Loans held-for-sale</p></li>
<li><p>Loans at fair value</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.</p>
<h5 id="loan-portfolio">Loan portfolio</h5>
<p>The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Residential real estate<sup>(a)</sup></p></li>
<li><p>Auto and other<sup>(b)</sup></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consumer, excluding credit card</strong></p>

<li><p>Commercial and industrial</p></li>
<li><p>Other<sup>(e)</sup></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wholesale<sup>(c)(d)</sup></strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.</p></li>
<li><p>Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.</p></li>
<li><p>Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.</p></li>
<li><p>The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.</p></li>
<li><p>Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.</p></li>

Net losses on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $(913) million, of which $(142) million related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.</p>
<h5 id="loan-modifications"><br />
Loan modifications</h5>
<p>The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications.</p>
<p>The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or</p></li>
<li><p>the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.</p>
<p>As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses.</p>
<p>Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio</strong> Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.</p>

<p>Approximately 35% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.</p>

<h5 id="loan-modifications-1">Loan modifications</h5>
<p>Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was</p>
<p>$251 million and $142 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.</p>
<p><em>Nature and extent of modifications</em></p>
<p>The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.</p>

<li><p>Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.</p></li>

<p>At March 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years.

Loan modifications</h5>
<p>Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.</p>
<p>The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were not material.</p>

<h5 id="loan-modifications-3">Loan modifications</h5>
<p>The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long- term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long- term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with</p>
<p>short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.</p>
<p>If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.</p>
<p><em>Financial effects of modifications and redefaults</em></p>
<p>The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.</p>

<p>For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments.

<p>Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the</p>

<li><p>Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.</p></li>
<li><p>When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.</p></li>

<h5 id="loan-modifications-4">Loan modifications</h5>
<p>Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of TDRs was $1.2 billion and</p>
<p>$954 million as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was</p>
<p>$428 million and $76 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The new TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets</p>
<p>in partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.</p>
<h2 id="note-12-allowance-for-credit-losses">Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses</h2>
<p>The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies.</p>
<h5 id="allowance-for-credit-losses-and-related-information-1">Allowance for credit losses and related information</h5>
<p>The table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.</p>

<li><p>At March 31, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $21.8 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $674.4 billion and $681.4 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $39.6 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.</p></li>
<li><p>Excludes the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94 million and $19 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Discussion of changes in the allowance</em></p>
<p>The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and</p></li>
<li><p>a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Further, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.</p>
<p>The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:</p>

<h5 id="vies-sponsored-by-third-parties">VIEs sponsored by third parties</h5>
<p>The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.</p>
<p><em>Tax credit vehicles</em></p>
<p>The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing</p>
<p>member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $23.1 billion and $23.6 billion, of which $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments.</p>
<p><em>Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)</em></p>
<p>The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.</p>
<p>In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.</p>
<h5 id="securitization-activity">Securitization activity</h5>
<p>The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, was $10.2 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.</p>
<h5 id="loan-securitizations">Loan securitizations</h5>
<p>The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations.</p>
<p>The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.</p>

<p>In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the</p>
<p>U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share</p>
<p>a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.</p>

<p><em>Options to repurchase delinquent loans</em></p>
<p>In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan</p>

<p>pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed.

Refer to Note 11 for additional information.</p>
<p>The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.</p>

<p><em>Goodwill impairment testing</em></p>
<p>Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test.</p>
<p>Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2021, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance for all its reporting units. The Firm has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of March 31, 2021, or</p>
<p>December 31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020.</p>
<h5 id="mortgage-servicing-rights">Mortgage servicing rights</h5>
<p>MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.</p>

<p><em>CECL regulatory capital transition delay</em></p>
<p>As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $4.5 billion,</p>
<p>which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $7.0 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD loans).</p>
<p>The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions.</p>
<p>The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank,</p>
<p>N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.</p>

<h2 id="note-22-offbalance-sheet-lending-related-financial-instruments-guarantees-and-other-commitments">Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies.</p>
<p>To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.</p>

<p>Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.</p>
<p><strong>Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees</strong> Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.</p>

<h5 id="merchant-charge-backs"><br />
Merchant charge-backs</h5>
<p>Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge- backs.</p>
<p><strong>Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications</strong> In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm.</p>
<p>The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.</p>
<h5 id="sponsored-member-repo-program">Sponsored member repo program</h5>
<p>The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &amp; clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 153. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.</p>
<h5 id="guarantees-of-subsidiaries">Guarantees of subsidiaries</h5>

<h2 id="note-24-litigation">Note 24 – Litigation</h2>
<h5 id="contingencies">Contingencies</h5>
<p>As of March 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.</p>
<p>The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.5 billion at March 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,</p></li>
<li><p>the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,</p></li>
<li><p>the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and</p></li>
<li><p>the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.</p>
<p>Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.</p>
<p><em>Amrapali</em>. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $25 million held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation.</p>
<p><em>Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.</em> JPMorgan Chase Bank,</p>
<p>N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022.</p>
<p><em>Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.</em> The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities.</p>
<p>Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded</p>
<p>guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten- year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.</p>
<p>In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10 million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.</p>
<p><em>Interchange Litigation.</em> Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.</p>
<p>The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized</p>
<p>an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately.</p>
<p>In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending.</p>
<p><em>LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation.</em> JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s ("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.</p>
<p>In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. Defendants opposed that motion, which remains pending. The Firm’s settlements of putative</p>
<p>class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.</p>
<p><em>Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries.</em> The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the</p>
<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.</p>
<p>The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations.</p>
<p>Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments.</p>
<p>Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021.</p>
<p>Two putative class action complaints have also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United</p>
<p>States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above- referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021.</p>
<p><em>Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation</em>. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions.</p>
<p>Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.</p>
<p><em>Wendel.</em> Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an <em>ordonnance de renvoi</em> in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French <em>tribunal correctionnel</em> for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the <em>mise en examen</em> of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a <em>mise en examen</em> is a prerequisite for an <em>ordonnance de renvoi</em> and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the <em>ordonnance de renvoi</em> referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French <em>tribunal correctionnel</em>. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the <em>tribunal correctionnel</em> directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan Chase’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of the <em>tribunal correctionnel</em> at this stage of the proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has</p>
<p>meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.</p>
<p>The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $28 million and</p>
<p>$197 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.</p>
<p>In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.</p>
<h2 id="note-25-business-segments">Note 25 – Business segments</h2>
<p>The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer &amp; Community Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &amp; Wealth Management.

<p>To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.:</p>
<h6 id="results-of-review-of-interim-financial-statements">Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements</h6>
<p>We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p>We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.</p>
<h6 id="basis-for-review-results"><br />
Basis for Review Results</h6>
<p>These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.</p>

Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity.

<h5 id="origination-date-ltv-ratio">Origination date LTV ratio</h5>
<p>The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.</p>
<h5 id="current-estimated-ltv-ratio">Current estimated LTV ratio</h5>
<p>An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.</p>

<h5 id="mortgage-product-types">Mortgage product types:</h5>
<p>Alt-A</p>
<p>Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;</p>
<p>(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.</p>
<p>Option ARMs</p>
<p>The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.</p>
<p>Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.</p>
<p>Prime</p>
<p>Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.</p>
<p>Subprime</p>
<p>Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.</p>

<p><strong>NM</strong>: Not meaningful</p>
<p><strong>Nonaccrual loans</strong>: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.</p>

JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.</p>
<p><strong>PCD:</strong> “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.</p>

<p><strong>Principal transactions revenue</strong>: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.</p>

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive</p>
<p>approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.</p>

<p><em>Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance:</em></p>
<p><strong>Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star</strong>: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds.</p>
<p>A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and</p>
<p>hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years):</strong> All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>

<p><span id="_bookmark34" class="anchor"></span><u>Item 4. Controls and Procedures.</u></p>
<p>As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and</p>
<p>31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.</p>
<p>The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 158 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<p><u>Item 1. Legal Proceedings.</u></p>
<p>Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.</p>
<p><u>Item 1A. Risk Factors.</u></p>
<p>The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations.</p>
<p>Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.</p>
<h5 id="the-covid-19-pandemic-has-caused-and-is-causing-significant-harm-to-the-global-economy-and-could-further-negatively-affect-certain-of-jpmorgan-chases-businesses.">The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.</h5>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global economic conditions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets</p></li>
<li><p>significant disruption of global supply chains, and</p></li>
<li><p>closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global economy.</p>
<p>The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic <span id="_bookmark35" class="anchor"></span>have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and</p></li>
<li><p>increases in the allowance for credit losses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments.</p>
<p>A prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have other significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>recognition of credit losses and further increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially to the extent that businesses remain closed, unemployment continues at elevated levels, clients and customers draw on their lines of credit or significant numbers of people relocate from metropolitan areas</p></li>
<li><p>material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets</p></li>
<li><p>downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings</p></li>
<li><p>constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) related to supporting client activities, downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies, and</p></li>
<li><p>the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, <span id="_bookmark36" class="anchor"></span>including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in- place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed</p>
<p>because of the impact of prior and potential future government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers.</p>
<p>In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny</p></li>
<li><p>negative publicity, and</p></li>
<li><p>increased exposure to litigation,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.</p>

<p><u>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of</u> <u>Proceeds.</u></p>
<p>The Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity securities during the three months ended March 31, 2021.</p>
<h5 id="repurchases-under-the-common-share-repurchase-program">Repurchases under the common share repurchase program</h5>
<p>Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of this Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the Firm’s common share repurchase program.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through at least the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during the three months ended March 31, 2021, were as follows.</p>
