Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business – Our Business Risks.” Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The discussion of risks in this report is by no means all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance.</em></p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="our-distribution-network">Our Distribution Network</h2>
<p>Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="direct-store-delivery">Direct-Store-Delivery</h3>
<p>We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="customer-warehouse">Customer Warehouse</h3>
<p>Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="distributor-networks">Distributor Networks</h3>
<p>We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="e-commerce">E-commerce</h3>
<p>Our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e- commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ingredients-and-other-supplies">Ingredients and Other Supplies</h2>
<p>The principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. During 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and other input costs and, in some instances, limited shortages due to global inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased demand and other regulatory and macroeconomic factors associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has continued into fiscal 2022. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements did not have a material impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7.

We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute Bang Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2022, we will also begin to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company. We have licensed the use of the Hard MTN Dew trademark to the Boston Beer Company, which has appointed us as their distributor for this product. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.</p>
<p>We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="seasonality">Seasonality</h2>
<p>Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="our-customers">Our Customers</h2>
<p>Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.</p>
<p>We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.</p>
<p>Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e- commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="our-competition">Our Competition</h2>
<p>Our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.</p>
<p>Many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2021, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 19%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.</p>
<p>Our beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="research-and-development">Research and Development</h2>
<p>We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve: innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes including reductions in cost and environmental footprint; implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy, protein, fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or otherwise sustainable packaging; development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research; continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our climate impact in our operations throughout our value chain.</p>
<p>Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods.</p>

It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health and safety; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; various state and federal laws pertaining to sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act); customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.</p>
<p>We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.</p>
<p>In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some types of single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.</p>
<p>We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.</p>

<p>The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Business Risks</u></strong></em></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-impact-of-covid-19-continues-to-create-considerable-uncertainty-for-our-business.">The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business.</h3>
<p>Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and continue to impact us, our business partners and consumers.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>We have seen and could continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. We also have seen and could continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences, including an increase in demand in the e- commerce channel, which has impacted and could continue to impact our sales and profitability. Reduced demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. In addition, we may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of COVID-19, resulting from temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. In addition, we and our business partners may also continue to see adverse impacts to our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 through raw material, packaging or other supply shortages, labor shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port congestion and closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our business. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials, packaging or other supplies can negatively impact our business. We have also incurred, and could continue to incur, increased employee and operating costs as a result of COVID-19, such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives, the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment reserves and inventory write-offs, and cost inflation in commodities, packaging, transportation and other input costs, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Also, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.</p>
<p>The impact of COVID-19 has heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the other risks discussed below. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reduction-in-future-demand-for-our-products-would-adversely-affect-our-business.">Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Consumer</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use, and the use of social media. These and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="damage-to-our-reputation-or-brand-image-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health concerns about our products, products we distribute, or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="product-recalls-or-other-issues-or-concerns-with-respect-to-product-quality-and-safety-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>We have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, particularly as we expand into new categories, such as nuts and meat convenient foods globally and the distribution of alcoholic beverages in the United States, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="any-inability-to-compete-effectively-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>Our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca- Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures.</p>

<p>Our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="water-scarcity-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Water scarcity can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing and sourcing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="disruption-of-our-manufacturing-operations-or-supply-chain-including-increased-commodity-packaging-transportation-labor-and-other-input-costs-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>We have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.</p>
<p>The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19), labor shortages (including the lack of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2021, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may</p>

<p>Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns or hostilities between countries) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, China, South Africa, Brazil and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="changes-in-economic-conditions-can-adversely-impact-our-business.">Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.</h3>
<p>Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns,</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>which have and could continue to result in adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="future-cyber-incidents-and-other-disruptions-to-our-information-systems-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following: transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers.</p>
<p>Similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.</p>
<p>Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="failure-to-successfully-complete-or-manage-strategic-transactions-can-adversely-affect-our-business.">Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business.</h3>
<p>We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, including the recent completion of the Juice Transaction, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business.</p>

<p>We rely on third-party service providers, including cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs,</p>

<p>In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have begun to roll out these systems in certain countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not continue to allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected.</p>

<p>Climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity which may result in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derived oils). In addition, climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs, which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could adversely affect demand for our products or damage our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently.

<p>We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an impairment charge, which can adversely affect our results of operations.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="fluctuations-in-exchange-rates-impact-our-financial-performance.">Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.</h3>
<p>Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.</p>

<p>Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.</p>

<p>Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of the ingredients or substances contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, certain provinces in Canada enacted a flat tax on all sugar-sweetened beverages, effective</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>September 1, 2022, at a rate of 0.20 Canadian dollars (0.16 U.S. dollars) per liter.

<p>Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. For example, Argentina and Colombia enacted warning labeling requirements in 2021 to indicate whether a particular pre-packaged food or beverage product is considered to be high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="laws-and-regulations-related-to-the-use-or-disposal-of-plastics-or-other-packaging-materials-can-adversely-affect-our-business-and-financial-performance.">Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance.</h3>
<p>We rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable or commercially compostable. However, not all packaging is recycled, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use plastics and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance.</p>

<p>We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and</p>

<p>regulations, including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation or residents of the state of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation, including those proposed and under consideration by the United States Congress and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, numerous countries have recently agreed to a statement in support of a global minimum tax rate of 15% as well as global profit reallocation. There can be no assurance that these changes will be adopted by individual countries, or that once adopted by individual countries, that they will not have adverse effects on our financial performance. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.</p>

<p>We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past infringed or been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. Such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.</p>

In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories, including our planned entry into the alcoholic beverage industry as a distributor in the United States and expansion into the nuts and meat convenient foods categories globally, has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business.</p>

<p>We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image.

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="our-business">OUR BUSINESS</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h2>
<p>PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.</p>
<p>As a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2021 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called PepsiCo Positive (pep+). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ will guide how we will work to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.</p>
<p>pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Agriculture</strong>: We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the Earth across land equal to the company's entire agricultural footprint (approximately 7 million acres), sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Value Chain</strong>: We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our SodaStream business globally, an innovative platform that almost entirely eliminates the need for beverage packaging, among other levers. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey. And we have introduced a new global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a</p></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Time, to encourage, support and empower each one of our approximately 309,000 employees to make positive impacts in their local communities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Choices</strong>: We continue working to evolve our portfolio of beverage and convenient food products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing food products that are better for the planet and/or deliver nutritional benefits, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts &amp; seeds category, where PepsiCo is already the global branded leader, including leadership positions in Mexico, China and several Western European markets; and accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio and cooking our food offerings with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including SodaStream – an icon of a Positive Choice and the largest sparkling water brand in the world by volume. SodaStream, already sold in more than 40 countries, and its new SodaStream Professional platform is expected to expand into functional beverages and reach additional markets by the end of 2022, part of the brand's effort to help consumers avoid plastic bottles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="our-business-risks">Our Business Risks</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="covid-19">COVID-19</h3>
<p>Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through labor shortages, raw</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>material shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our business partners to do the same or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely.</p>
<p>Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away- from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position.</p>
<p>Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty (including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages), can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.</p>
<p>While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="risks-associated-with-commodities-and-our-supply-chain">Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain</h3>
<p>Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue in 2022. A number of external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity availability and costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.</p>
<p>See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="risks-associated-with-climate-change">Risks Associated with Climate Change</h3>
<p>Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements could result in significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="risks-associated-with-international-operations">Risks Associated with International Operations</h3>
<p>We are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="imposition-of-taxes-and-regulations-on-our-products">Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products</h3>
<p>Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging,</p>

<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.</p>
<p>We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="retail-landscape">Retail Landscape</h3>
<p>Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e- commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e- commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.</p>
<p>See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="risk-management-framework">Risk Management Framework</h3>
<p>The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PepsiCo’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to food safety and cybersecurity. During 2021, in addition to COVID-19 discussions as part of risk updates to the Board and the relevant Committees, the Board was provided with updates on COVID-19’s impact to our business, financial condition and operations through memos, teleconferences or other appropriate means of communication. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo;</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;</p></li>
<li><p>The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and</p></li>
<li><p>The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board;</p></li>
<li><p>Division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;</p></li>
<li><p>PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;</p></li>
<li><p>PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and</p></li>
<li><p>PepsiCo’s Compliance &amp; Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="market-risks">Market Risks</h3>
<p>We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;</p></li>
<li><p>foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and</p></li>
<li><p>interest rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks.</p>
<p>The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.</p>
<p><em>Commodity Prices</em></p>
<p>Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.</p>
<p><em>Foreign Exchange</em></p>
<p>Our operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021, favorable foreign exchange contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth, primarily due to appreciation in the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and South African rand. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.</p>
<p>In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.</p>
<p>Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.</p>
<p>The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.</p>
<p><em>Interest Rates</em></p>
<p>Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020. Assuming year-end 2021 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2021 by $47 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short- term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="results-of-operations-consolidated-review">Results of Operations — Consolidated Review</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="volume">Volume</h3>
<p>Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company- owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co- branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi.</p>
<p>Convenient food volume includes volume sold by our subsidiaries and noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.</p>

<p>See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.</p>
<p>Operating profit grew 11% and operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 14-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating margin decline primarily reflects higher commodity costs.</p>
<p>Lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, lower acquisition and divestiture-related charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="juice-transaction">Juice Transaction</h2>
<p>In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery.

<p>(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, including the impact of an extra month of volume for our acquisitions of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) in our AMESA division and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be &amp; Cheery) in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE.</p>

<p>Net revenue grew 8%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in variety packs and the impact of our BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY Brands) acquisition in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in trademark Tostitos and a double-digit decline in trademark Santitas.</p>
<p>Operating profit increased 5.5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging material and cooking oil.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="qfna">QFNA</h1>
<p>Net revenue grew slightly and unit volume declined 7%. The net revenue growth reflects effective net pricing and a 1-percentage- point impact of favorable foreign exchange, largely offset by a decrease in organic volume. The unit volume decline was primarily driven by double-digit declines in pancake syrups and mixes and in ready-to-eat cereals and a high-single-digit decline in oatmeal, partially offset by growth in Cheetos macaroni and cheese, which was introduced in the third quarter of 2020, and double-digit growth in lite snacks.</p>
<p>Operating profit declined 14%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>
<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance compared to the significant COVID-19 related surge in consumer demand in the prior year.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="pbna">PBNA</h1>
<p>Net revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. Unit volume increased 6%, driven by a 7% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a 4% increase in CSD volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in our</p>

<p>overall water portfolio and our energy portfolio, a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks and a mid-single-digit increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas.</p>
<p>Operating profit increased 26%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, a 15-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, an 18-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Higher prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth.</p>
<p>Changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance.</p>

<p>Operating profit increased 33%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4.5-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 30-percentage- point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. A current-year recognition of certain indirect tax credits in Brazil and lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth.</p>

<p>(a) In 2021, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 7 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.</p>
<p>Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $405 million, primarily reflecting lower settlement charges in 2021, the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved in 2020, as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.</p>
<p>Net interest expense and other increased $735 million, reflecting a charge of $842 million in connection with our cash tender offers. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. This impact was partially offset by lower interest rates on average debt balances.</p>
<p>The reported tax rate increased 0.9 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax impact of adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to the final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="non-gaap-measures">Non-GAAP Measures</h2>
<p>Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with</p>
<p>U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.</p>
<p>We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Previously, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical- related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.</p>
<p>The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below:</p>
<p><em>Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates</em></p>
<p>These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), costs associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.</p>
<p><em>Organic revenue growth</em></p>
<p>We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and where applicable, the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53<sup>rd</sup> reporting week), including in our 2022 financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be &amp; Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.</p>
<p>See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations <strong>–</strong> Division Review” for further information.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p><em>Free cash flow</em></p>
<p>We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.</p>
<p>See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.</p>
<p><em>Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability</em></p>
<p>We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.</p>
<p>We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="mark-to-market-net-impact">Mark-to-Market Net Impact</h3>
<p>We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.</p>

<p><em>2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan</em></p>
<p>The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately</p>
<p>$1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 25, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.0 billion, including cash expenditures of $776 million. In our 2022 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $350 million, including cash expenditures of approximately $300 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026.</p>
<p>See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, closing costs, employee-related costs, gains associated with contingent consideration, contract termination costs and other integration costs.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="our-liquidity-and-capital-resources">Our Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions, including support for socioeconomic programs in South Africa related to our acquisition of Pioneer Foods; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.</p>
<p>Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.</p>
<p>As of December 25, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.</p>
<p>The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.</p>
<p>As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="operating-activities">Operating Activities</h3>
<p>In 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.6 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable working capital comparisons and operating profit performance, partially offset by higher pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions and higher net cash tax payments in the current year.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="investing-activities">Investing Activities</h3>
<p>In 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>In 2020, net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of Rockstar of $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion and Be &amp; Cheery of $0.7 billion, net capital spending of</p>
<p>$4.2 billion, as well as purchases of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities; and see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.</p>
<p>We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="financing-activities">Financing Activities</h3>
<p>In 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $10.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billion and</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.1 billion.</p>
<p>In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $13.8 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.</p>
<p>We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and expired on June 30, 2021. On February 10, 2022, we announced the 2022 share repurchase program. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for further information. In addition, on February 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2022. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion.</p>

<p>We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.</p>
<p>Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="our-critical-accounting-policies-and-estimates">OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</h1>
<p>An appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.</p>
<p>Our critical accounting policies and estimates are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>revenue recognition;</p></li>
<li><p>goodwill and other intangible assets;</p></li>
<li><p>income tax expense and accruals; and</p></li>
<li><p>pension and retiree medical plans.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="revenue-recognition">Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.</p>
<p>Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.</p>
<p>We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.</p>
<p>Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.</p>
<p>As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.</p>
<p>A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.</p>
<p>See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="goodwill-and-other-intangible-assets">Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.</p>
<p>We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.</p>
<p>In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.</p>
<p>Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.</p>
<p>In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.”</p>
<p>Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.</p>
<p>See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="income-tax-expense-and-accruals">Income Tax Expense and Accruals</h2>
<p>Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.</p>
<p>An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior- year tax matters to be among such items.</p>
<p>Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>In 2021, our annual tax rate was 21.8% compared to 20.9% in 2020. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pension-and-retiree-medical-plans">Pension and Retiree Medical Plans</h2>
<p>Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.</p>
<p>See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="our-assumptions">Our Assumptions</h3>
<p>The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and</p>
<p>(3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.</p>
<p>Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;</p></li>
<li><p>the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;</p></li>
<li><p>the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;</p></li>
<li><p>for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and</p></li>
<li><p>for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.</p>
<p>At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.</p>
<p>See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.</p>
<p>The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.</p>

<p>Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2022 primarily reflecting plan changes and related impacts, and higher discount rates.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="sensitivity-of-assumptions">Sensitivity of Assumptions</h3>
<p>A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2022 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:</p>
<p>Assumption Amount</p>
<p>Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 37</p>
<p>Expected rate of return $ 49</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="funding">Funding</h3>
<p>We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.</p>
<p>We made discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans of $75 million in January 2022 and expect to make an additional $75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="basis-of-presentation">Basis of Presentation</h3>
<p>The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.</p>
<p>Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.</p>
<p>The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite- lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.</p>
<p>Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53<sup>rd</sup> reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented:</p>
<p>Quarter United States and Canada International</p>
<p>First Quarter 12 weeks January, February</p>
<p>Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May</p>
<p>Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August</p>
<p>Fourth Quarter 16 weeks September, October, November and December</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="our-divisions">Our Divisions</h3>
<p>We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>FLNA, which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;</p></li>
<li><p>QFNA, which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;</p></li>
<li><p>PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;</p></li>
<li><p>LatAm, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;</p></li>
<li><p>Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;</p></li>
<li><p>AMESA, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and</p></li>
<li><p>APAC, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa.</p>
<p>The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:</p>

<p>The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.</p>
<p><em>Pension and Retiree Medical Expense</em></p>
<p>Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p><em>Derivatives</em></p>
<p>We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-2-our-significant-accounting-policies">Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="revenue-recognition-1">Revenue Recognition</h3>
<p>We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.</p>
<p>The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.</p>
<p>Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.</p>
<p>We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.</p>
<p>We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="total-marketplace-spending">Total Marketplace Spending</h3>
<p>We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.</p>
<p>A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.</p>
<p>The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $262 million as of December 25, 2021 and $299 million as of December 26, 2020 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.</p>
<p>For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.</p>
<p>Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.1 billion in 2021,</p>
<p>$4.6 billion in 2020 and $4.7 billion in 2019, including advertising expenses of $3.5 billion in 2021 and $3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>media and personal service prepayments;</p></li>
<li><p>promotional materials in inventory; and</p></li>
<li><p>production costs of future media advertising.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Deferred advertising costs of $53 million and $48 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="distribution-costs">Distribution Costs</h3>
<p>Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, $11.9 billion in 2020 and $10.9 billion in 2019.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="software-costs">Software Costs</h3>
<p>We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $135 million in 2021,</p>
<p>$152 million in 2020 and $166 million in 2019. Net capitalized software and development costs were $809 million and $664 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="commitments-and-contingencies">Commitments and Contingencies</h3>
<p>We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="research-and-development-1">Research and Development</h3>
<p>We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $752 million, $719 million and $711 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="goodwill-and-other-intangible-assets-1">Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</h3>
<p>Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.</p>
<p>In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.</p>
<p>Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="recently-issued-accounting-pronouncements---adopted">Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted</h3>
<p>In 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction,</p>
<p>(3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="multi-year-productivity-plan">2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan</h3>
<p>The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.</p>
<p>The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:</p>

<p>Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="indefinite-lived-intangible-assets">Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets</h3>
<p>We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 25, 2021. In 2020, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41 million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 28, 2019. As of December 25, 2021, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.</p>
<p>We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended December 25, 2021. The estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on macroeconomic conditions (including a resulting increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value), future revenues and their contributions to operating results and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), and significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe segment. As a result, we will recognize pre-tax impairment charges of approximately $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 in selling, general and administrative expenses.</p>

<p>In 2021, we recorded $190 million ($0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 IRS audit. There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act.</p>
<p>As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million in 2021, $78 million in 2020 and $663 million in 2019. We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022.</p>
<p>The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary</p>

<p>differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="other-tax-matters">Other Tax Matters</h3>
<p>In 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million in 2021.</p>
<p>On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2021, no income tax adjustments related to the TRAF were recorded. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded a net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reserves">Reserves</h3>
<p>A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>Jurisdiction</em> Years Open to Audit</strong></p>
<p>United States 2014-2020 2014-2019</p>
<p><strong>Years Currently Under Audit</strong></p>
<p>Mexico 2014-2020 2014-2016</p>
<p>United Kingdom 2018-2020 None</p>
<p>Canada (Domestic) 2016-2020 2016-2017</p>
<p>Canada (International) 2010-2020 2010-2017</p>
<p>Russia 2018-2020 None</p>
<p>Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.</p>
<p>As of December 25, 2021, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.9 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $326 million as of December 25, 2021, of which $3 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2021. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $338 million as of December 26, 2020, of which $93 million of tax expense was recognized in 2020.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="carryforwards-and-allowances">Carryforwards and Allowances</h3>
<p>Operating loss carryforwards totaling $30.0 billion as of December 25, 2021 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.3 billion in 2022, $26.8 billion between 2023 and 2041 and $2.9 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="undistributed-international-earnings">Undistributed International Earnings</h3>
<p>As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-6-share-based-compensation">Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation</h2>
<p>Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long- term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.</p>
<p>The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.</p>
<p>As of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.</p>

<p>As of December 25, 2021, there was $372 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="method-of-accounting-and-our-assumptions">Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions</h3>
<p>The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.</p>
<p>We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="stock-options">Stock Options</h3>
<p>A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.</p>
<p>Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:</p>

<p>The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.</p>

<p>Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.</p>
<p>The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 25, 2021 is as follows:</p>

<p>In connection with our Juice Transaction subsequent to December 25, 2021, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of approximately $150 million and related assets to the newly formed joint venture.</p>
<p>In 2021, we adopted a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.</p>
<p>In 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) to PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), effective January 1, 2022. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.</p>
<p>In 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A of $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share).</p>
<p>In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.</p>
<p>In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a more targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization.</p>
<p>In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan</p>
<p>H. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense.</p>
<p>In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share).</p>
<p>Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).</p>

<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 9 years), Plan H (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 9 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 27 years).</p>
<p>The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze, or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.</p>

<li><p>Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.</p></li>
<li><p>Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.</p></li>
<li><p>Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).</p></li>
<li><p>Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.</p></li>

<p>(a) Includes $500 million contribution in 2021, $325 million contribution in 2020 and $400 million contribution in 2019 to fund our qualified defined benefit plans in the United States.</p>
<p>We made a discretionary contribution of $75 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in January 2022 and expect to make an additional $75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022. In addition, in 2022, we expect to make non- discretionary contributions of approximately $135 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately</p>
<p>$55 million for retiree medical benefits.</p>
<p>We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="plan-assets">Plan Assets</h3>
<p>Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.</p>
<p>For 2022 and 2021, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:</p>

<p>Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.</p>
<p>The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.</p>
<p>Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2021 and 2020 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows:</p>

<p>As a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million ($677 million after-tax or $0.49 per share) to net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.

<p>In 2021, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 28, 2026. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year,</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion five year credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019.</p>
<p>Also in 2021, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2022. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 25, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.</p>
<p>In 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately</p>
<p>$1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted.</p>
<p>In 2021, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70% senior notes due 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million.</p>
<p>In 2020, we paid $1.1 billion to redeem all $1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15% senior notes due 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $0.8 billion.</p>
<p>In 2019, we paid $1.0 billion to redeem all $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2020.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-9-financial-instruments">Note 9 — Financial Instruments</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="derivatives-and-hedging">Derivatives and Hedging</h3>
<p>We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;</p></li>
<li><p>foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and</p></li>
<li><p>interest rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.</p>
<p>Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 25, 2021 were not material.</p>
<p>Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.</p>
<p><em>Credit Risk</em></p>
<p>We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.</p>
<p>Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&amp;P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 25, 2021 was $247 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 25, 2021.</p>
<p><em>Commodity Prices</em></p>
<p>We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.</p>
<p>Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020.</p>
<p><em>Foreign Exchange</em></p>
<p>We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.</p>
<p><em>Interest Rates</em></p>
<p>We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross- currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.</p>
<p>Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020.</p>
<p>As of December 25, 2021, approximately 2% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 3%, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 26, 2020.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="held-to-maturity-debt-securities">Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities</h3>
<p>Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to- maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of December 25, 2021, we had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 26, 2020, we had $2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $0.1 billion in short-term investments. As of December 25, 2021, we had $130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 26, 2020, we had</p>
<p>$260 million of investments in commercial paper with $75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $185 million in short-term investments. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.</p>

<p>We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.</p>
<p>As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.</p>
<p>We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="acquisitions">2020 Acquisitions</h3>
<p>On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020.</p>
<p>In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.5 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and was primarily settled in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining commitment of 6.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five- year period from the acquisition date.</p>
<p>On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $0.88 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option to accelerate all remaining payments due under the contingent consideration arrangement. See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be &amp; Cheery, one of the largest online convenient food companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $0.7 billion.</p>

<p>We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods, Rockstar and Be &amp; Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates is summarized as follows:</p>

<p>Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized.</p>
<p>The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Pioneer Foods primarily reflects synergies expected to arise from our combined brand portfolios and distribution networks, and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the AMESA segment.</p>
<p>The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Rockstar primarily represents the value of PepsiCo’s expected new innovation in the energy category and is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the PBNA segment.</p>
<p>The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Be &amp; Cheery primarily reflects growth opportunities for PepsiCo as we leverage Be &amp; Cheery’s direct-to-consumer and supply chain capabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the APAC segment.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="juice-transaction-1">Juice Transaction</h3>
<p>In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately</p>
<p>$3.5 billion in cash and a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we will provide certain services to the joint venture to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, the new joint venture is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. We expect to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in our PBNA and Europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.</p>
<p>We have reclassified $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of</p>

<p>The Juice Transaction does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.</p>

<p>To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.:</p>
<p><em>Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</em></p>
<p>We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021 based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.</p>
<p><em>Basis for Opinions</em></p>
<p>The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.</p>
<p>Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p><em>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</em></p>
<p>A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that</p>
<p>(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
<p><em>Critical Audit Matters</em></p>
<p>The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.</p>
<p><em>Sales incentive accruals</em></p>
<p>As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.</p>
<p>We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.</p>
<p><em>Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands</em></p>
<p>As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 25, 2021 was $35.5 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of December 25, 2021.</p>
<p>We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe’s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating</p>
<p>(1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.</p>
<p><em>Unrecognized tax benefits</em></p>
<p>As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 25, 2021, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.</p>
<p>We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is</p>
<p><u>Table of Contents</u></p>
<p>complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.</p>

<li><p><em><strong>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.</strong></em> During our fourth quarter of 2021, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an ERP solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, we began implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes.

<p>Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="description-of-common-stock">DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK</h1>
<p>The following description of our common stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, effective as of May 1, 2019 (“Articles of Incorporation”), our By-Laws, as amended and restated, effective as of April 15, 2020 (“By-Laws”) and applicable provisions of law. We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By- Laws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. You should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for the provisions that are important to you.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general">General</h2>
<p>Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds cents (1-2/3 cents) per share. As of February 3, 2022, there</p>
<p>were 1,383,451,400 shares of common stock outstanding which were held of record by 101,778 shareholders.</p>
<p><em>Voting Rights.</em> Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the applicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.</p>
<p><em>Dividend Rights.</em> Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by PepsiCo’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="certain-provisions-of-pepsicos-articles-of-incorporation-and-by-laws-director-indemnification-agreements">Certain Provisions of PepsiCo’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws; Director Indemnification Agreements</h2>
<p><em>Advance Notice of Proposals and Nominations.</em> Our By-Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written notice to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders. Notice for</p>
<p>an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, such notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing “proxy access” must meet separate deadlines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder’s notice. These provisions may prevent shareholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or from nominating candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.</p>
<p><em>Proxy Access.</em> Our By-Laws contain “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareholder (or a group of up to 20 shareholders aggregating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable annual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of our By-Laws.</p>
<p><em>Special Meetings.</em> A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the Board or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more shareholders holding shares of record representing at least 20% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at the request of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the date of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary. The By- Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder’s request for a special meeting.</p>
<p><em>Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees.</em> Our By-Laws provide that unless the Board determines otherwise, we shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an action, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the fact that such person, such person’s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, officers or employees, or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer or employee of</p>
<p>another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. Pursuant to our By-Laws this indemnification may, at the Board’s discretion, also include advancement of expenses prior to the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.</p>
<p>In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each director against any and all liabilities and assessments (including attorneys’ fees and other costs, expenses and obligations) arising out of or related to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or other, including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval), and any interest, assessments, excise taxes or other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any of the foregoing, incurred by the independent director and arising out of his status as a director or member of a committee of our Board, or by reason of anything done or not done by the director in such capacities. After receipt of an appropriate request by an independent director, we will also advance all expenses, costs and other obligations (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to such matters. We will not be liable for payment of any liability or expense incurred by an independent director on account of acts which, at the time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in conflict with our best interests.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="certain-anti-takeover-effects-of-north-carolina-law">Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of North Carolina Law</h2>
<p>The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the affirmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’s voting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly, more than 20% and is still an “affiliate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.</p>
<p>“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any merger, consolidation or conversion of a corporation with or into any other entity, or (ii) any sale or lease of all or any substantial part of the corporation’s assets to any other entity, or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for</p>
<p>securities of the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other entity.</p>
<p>The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act contains provisions that allowed a corporation to “opt out” of the applicability of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act’s voting provisions within specified time periods that generally have expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.</p>
<p>This statute could discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial position in our equity securities or seeking to obtain control of us.

<p><em>Ranking</em>. The notes rank equally and pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of PepsiCo.</p>
<p><em>No Sinking Fund</em>. No series of notes is subject to any sinking fund.</p>
<p><em>Additional Notes</em>. We may, without the consent of the existing holders of the notes of a series, issue additional notes of such series having the same terms (except issue date, date from which interest accrues and, in some cases, the first interest payment date) so that the existing notes of such series and the new notes of such series form a single series under the indenture. As of February 3, 2022, no such additional notes have been issued.</p>
<p><em>Minimum Denominations</em>. The sterling notes were issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The euro notes were issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.</p>
<p><em>Global Notes</em>. The notes of each series are in the form of one or more global notes that we deposited with or on behalf of a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and are registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary.</p>
<p><em>Paying Agent</em>. We have initially appointed The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch to act as paying agent and transfer agent in connection with the notes as well as to serve as the common depositary for the notes. The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch is an affiliate of the trustee. The term “paying agent” shall include The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch and any successors appointed from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the indenture.</p>
<p><em>Currency of Payment of Sterling Notes</em>. The principal and interest payments in respect of the sterling notes are payable in sterling. If the United Kingdom adopts euro, in lieu of sterling, as its lawful currency, the sterling notes will be redenominated in euro on a date determined by us, in our sole discretion, with a principal amount for each sterling note equal to the principal amount of that note in sterling, converted into euro at the rate established by the applicable law;</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>provided that, if we determine after consultation with the paying agent that the then current market practice in respect of redenomination into euro of internationally offered securities is different from the provisions specified above, such provisions will be deemed to be amended so as to comply with such market practice and we will promptly notify the trustee and the paying agent of such deemed amendment. We will give 30 days’ notice of the redenomination date to the paying agent, the trustee, Euroclear and Clearstream.</p>
<p>If sterling or, in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control (other than, with respect to sterling, due to the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph but including the dissolution of the euro, if applicable), then all payments in respect of the sterling notes will be made in U.S. dollars until sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again available to us. The amount payable on any date in sterling or, in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for sterling or euro, as the case may be, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in euro or U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.</p>
<p><em>Currency of Payment of Euro Notes</em>. The principal and interest payments in respect of the euro notes, including payments made upon any redemption of any series of the euro notes, are payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the euro notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for euro, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the euro notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the euro notes or the indenture governing the euro notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.</p>
<p><em>Definition of Business Day</em>. The term “business day” with respect to the sterling notes means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive order to close.</p>
<p>The term “business day” with respect to the euro notes means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. If any interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date is not a business day, then the related payment for such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay.</p>
<p><em>Interest Payments</em>. Each series of notes will bear interest at the per annum rate stated in its title. Interest on the notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue for the period to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Markets Association.</p>

<p>“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a United Kingdom government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the sterling notes, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion considers that such similar bond is not in issue, such other United Kingdom government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, United Kingdom government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.</p>
<p>“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each sterling note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such sterling note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.</p>

<p><em>Definitions</em></p>
<p>“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date for each series of euro notes, the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on such euro notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.</p>

<p><em>General</em></p>
<p>On and after the applicable redemption date with respect to a series of notes, interest will cease to accrue on such notes or any portion of such notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with the trustee or its agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and (unless the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date on the notes to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the notes of a series are to be redeemed, the notes of such series to be redeemed shall be selected in accordance with applicable depositary procedures.

<p>The notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the notes. Except as specifically provided under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts,” we will not be required to make any payment for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.</p>
<p>As used under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “—Redemption for Tax Reasons,” the term “United States” means the United States of America (including the states of the United States and the District of Columbia and any political subdivision thereof) and the term “United States person” means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United States person under any applicable Treasury regulations), or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source.</p>

<p><em>Limitation of Liens</em></p>
<p>We will not, and will not permit any of our restricted subsidiaries to, incur, suffer to exist or guarantee any debt secured by a lien on any principal property or on any shares of stock of (or other interests in) any of our restricted subsidiaries unless we or that first-mentioned restricted subsidiary secures or causes such restricted subsidiary to secure the notes (and any of its or such restricted subsidiary’s other debt, at its option or such restricted subsidiary’s option, as the case may be, not subordinate to the notes), equally and ratably with (or prior to) such secured debt, for as long as such secured debt will be so secured.</p>
<p>These restrictions will not, however, apply to debt secured by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>any liens existing prior to the issuance of such notes;</p></li>
<li><p>any lien on property of or shares of stock of (or other interests in) or debt of any entity existing at the time such entity becomes a restricted subsidiary;</p></li>
<li><p>any liens on property, shares of stock of (or other interests in) or debt of any entity (a) existing at the time of acquisition of such property or shares (or other interests) (including acquisition through merger or consolidation),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(b) to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of such property or shares (or other interests) or construction or improvement of such property or (c) to secure any debt incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 365 days after the later of the acquisition, the completion of construction or the commencement of full operation of such property or within 365 days after the acquisition of such shares (or other interests) for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price of such shares (or other interests) or construction thereon;</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">

</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we or any of our restricted subsidiaries may incur, suffer to exist or guarantee any debt secured by a lien on any principal property or on any shares of stock of (or other interests in) any of our restricted subsidiaries if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such debt does not exceed 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets.</p>
<p>The indenture does not restrict the transfer by us of a principal property to any of our unrestricted subsidiaries or our ability to change the designation of a subsidiary owning principal property from a restricted subsidiary to an unrestricted subsidiary and, if we were to do so, any such unrestricted subsidiary would not be restricted from incurring secured debt nor would we be required, upon such incurrence, to secure the notes equally and ratably with such secured debt.</p>
<p><em>Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets</em></p>
<p>We may consolidate or merge with or into, or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, any entity (including, without limitation, a limited partnership or a limited liability company); <em>provided</em> that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we will be the surviving corporation or, if not, that the successor will be a corporation that is organized and validly existing under the laws of any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia and will expressly assume by a supplemental indenture our obligations under the indenture and the notes;</p></li>
<li><p>immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no event of default, and no default or other event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, will have happened and be continuing; and</p></li>
<li><p>we will have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer complies with the indenture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, any such successor will succeed to and be substituted for us as obligor on the notes with the same effect as if it had been named in the indenture as obligor, and we will be released from all obligations under the indenture and under the notes.</p>
<p><em>Definitions</em></p>
<p>“Consolidated net tangible assets” means the total amount of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries’ assets minus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>all applicable depreciation, amortization and other valuation reserves;</p></li>
<li><p>all current liabilities of ours and our restricted subsidiaries (excluding any intercompany liabilities); and</p></li>
<li><p>all goodwill, trade names, trademarks, patents, unamortized debt discount and expenses and other like intangibles, all as set forth on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ latest consolidated balance sheets prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Debt” means any indebtedness for borrowed money.</p>
<p>“Principal property” means any single manufacturing or processing plant, office building or warehouse owned or leased by us or any of our restricted subsidiaries other than a plant, warehouse, office building or portion thereof which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, is not of material importance to the business conducted by us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as an entirety.</p>
<p>“Restricted subsidiary” means, at any time, any subsidiary which at the time is not an unrestricted subsidiary of ours.</p>
<p>“Subsidiary” means any entity, at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock of which shall at the time be owned, directly or indirectly, by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries, or both.</p>
<p>“Unrestricted subsidiary” means any subsidiary of ours (not at the time designated as our restricted subsidiary) (1) the major part of whose business consists of finance, banking, credit, leasing, insurance, financial services or other similar operations, or any combination thereof, (2) substantially all the assets of which consist of the capital stock of one or more subsidiaries engaged in the operations referred to in the preceding clause (1), or (3) designated as an unrestricted subsidiary by our Board of Directors.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="events-of-default">Events of Default</h2>
<p>An “Event of Default” under the notes of a given series means:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>default in paying interest on the notes when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or more;</p></li>
<li><p>default in paying principal, or premium, if any, on the notes when due;</p></li>
<li><p>default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes due, and such default continues for 30 days or more;</p></li>
<li><p>default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of PepsiCo in the indenture (other than defaults specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and the default or breach continues for a period of 90 days or more after we receive written notice from the trustee or we and the trustee receive notice from the holders of at least 51% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series;</p></li>
<li><p>certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, administration or similar proceedings with respect to PepsiCo have occurred; or</p></li>
<li><p>any other Events of Default set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo) under the indenture occurs with respect to the notes of any series and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series may by written notice require us to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes), together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any.</p>
<p>If an Event of Default under the indenture specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes) will automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder.</p>
<p>After a declaration of acceleration, the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes of any series may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default, except for nonpayment of the principal and interest on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement, have been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in paying principal, premium or interest on any outstanding note, or in respect of a covenant or a provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of all holders of the notes of that series.</p>
<p>Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series may seek to institute a proceeding only after they have notified the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In addition, within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a holder of a note for the enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any premium on or after the due dates for such payment.</p>
<p>During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct of that person’s own affairs. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee is not under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity. Subject to certain provisions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.</p>
<p>The trustee will, within 90 days after any default occurs, give notice of the default to the holders of the notes of that series, unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when due, the trustee can withhold giving notice to the holders if it determines in good faith that the withholding of notice is in the interest of the holders.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="modification-and-waiver">Modification and Waiver</h2>
<p>The indenture may be amended or modified without the consent of any holder of notes in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>evidence a succession to the trustee;</p></li>
<li><p>cure ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies;</p></li>
<li><p>provide for the assumption of our obligations in the case of a merger or consolidation or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets;</p></li>
<li><p>make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the notes of a series;</p></li>
<li><p>add guarantors with respect to the notes of any series;</p></li>
<li><p>secure the notes of a series;</p></li>
<li><p>establish the form or forms of notes of any series;</p></li>
<li><p>maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; or</p></li>
<li><p>make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any holder.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other amendments and modifications of the indenture or the notes issued may be made with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series affected by the amendment or modification. However, no modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note affected:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reduce the principal amount, interest or premium payable, or extend the fixed maturity, of the notes;</p></li>
<li><p>alter or waive the redemption provisions of the notes;</p></li>
<li><p>change the currency in which principal, any premium or interest is paid;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the percentage in principal amount outstanding of notes of any series which must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver or consent to take any action;</p></li>
<li><p>impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on the notes;</p></li>
<li><p>waive a payment default with respect to the notes or any guarantor;</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the interest rate or extend the time for payment of interest on the notes;</p></li>
<li><p>adversely affect the ranking of the notes of any series; or</p></li>
<li><p>release any guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in compliance with the terms of the indenture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="satisfaction-discharge-and-covenant-defeasance">Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant Defeasance</h2>
<p>We may terminate our obligations under the indenture, when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>all the notes of any series issued that have been authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or</p></li>
<li><p>all the notes of any series issued that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and payable, will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year and we have made arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by such trustee in our name and at our expense, and in each case, we have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee sufficient funds to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the series of notes to pay principal, interest and any premium; and</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums then due and payable under the indenture; and</p></li>
<li><p>we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been complied with.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We may elect to have our obligations under the indenture discharged with respect to the outstanding notes of any series (“legal defeasance”). Legal defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding notes of such series under the indenture, except for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the rights of holders of the notes to receive principal, interest and any premium when due;</p></li>
<li><p>our obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of transfer of the notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment for security payments held in trust;</p></li>
<li><p>the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and</p></li>
<li><p>the defeasance provisions of the indenture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certain covenants in the indenture (“covenant defeasance”). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the notes of any series. In the event covenant defeasance occurs, certain events, not including non-payment, bankruptcy and insolvency events, described under “Events of Default” above will no longer constitute an event of default for that series.</p>
<p>In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to outstanding notes of any series:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we must irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to the benefit of the holders of the notes of a series:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>money in an amount;</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations in the case of notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars or a specified currency) that will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount; or</p></li>
<li><p>a combination of money and U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations, as applicable),</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="book-entry-delivery-and-settlement">Book-Entry, Delivery and Settlement</h2>
<p>We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any time.</p>
<p>The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear, either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers through customers’ securities accounts in Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear. The address of Clearstream is 42 Avenue JF Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg,</p>
<p>Luxembourg and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.</p>
<p>The distribution of the notes was cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the notes will take place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro with respect to the euro notes, except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.</p>
<p>Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to be issued, held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the secondary market.</p>
<p>The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the investor’s interest in the notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants. We also do not supervise these systems in any way.</p>
<p>Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers. You should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.</p>
<p>Except as provided otherwise, owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes.</p>
<p><em>Certificated Notes</em>. Subject to certain conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the euro notes if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;</p></li>
<li><p>we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all the notes of any series represented by the global note; or</p></li>
<li><p>default entitling the holders of the applicable notes of any series to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and is continuing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any note of any series that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes of such series issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the common depositary (or its nominee).</p>
<p><em>Same-day Payment</em>. Payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) and transfers with respect to notes of any series in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the applicable notes of such series, provided that all payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required.</p>

<p>PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan effective as of September 1, 1980. The Plan at that time was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.” The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, effective September 2, 1982.</p>
<p>The Plan was again amended and restated effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules”</p>
<p>(applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took effect.</p>
<p>The Plan was further amended effective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States of America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but</p>
<p>instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject to U.S. taxation.</p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan document. The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in effect, and it sets forth the terms of the “DB Program.”</p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2011, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (<em>i.e.</em>, employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together, the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee</p>
<p>communications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP.”</p>
<p>The DC Program was previously amended and restated, effective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country</p>
<p>outside of their home country, (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.</p>
<p>The DC Program was again amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2019. As part of that amendment and restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to recognize same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners for certain purposes for</p>
<p>Members actively employed or on authorized leave of absence on and after January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The DC Program is hereby amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2021.</p>
<p>At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’s individual employer. With respect to his employer, the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor. The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the</p>
<p>United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.</p>

For this purpose, the relevant time includes a sufficient period before the Eligible Employee’s Proposed Entry Date as is necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the United</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Pa</u>y <u>Credit</u>. To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Year, an individual must be an Active Member during such year. The amount of an Active Member’s Pay Credit for a Plan Year shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member’s annualized Salary in effect as of that year’s Valuation Date by the Active Member’s applicable percentage, which shall be one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Effective for any Eligible Employee who becomes an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021 and who does not have any Service completed while a U.S. Person, the amount of the Active Member’s Pay Credits shall be determined by the number of “points” attributed to the Active Member in accordance with the following:</p>
<p><u>Points</u> <u>Amount of Pa</u>y <u>Credit</u> Less than 35 5% of Eligible Pay</p>
<p>35-39 6% of Eligible Pay</p>

<p>55-59 10% of Eligible Pay</p>
<p>60-64 11% of Eligible Pay 65 or more 12% of Eligible Pay</p>
<p>Such an Active Member’s points shall be determined by the sum of the Active Member’s age and years of Service, with each expressed in whole years and days.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Vice President shall specify the Active Member’s applicable percentage as of the Active Member’s Entry Date (or, if the Member ceases to be an Active Member, and then becomes an Active Member again, as of the date the Member again becomes an Active Member). For each subsequent Plan Year that the individual is an Active Member, the Vice President may specify a new applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Year. An Active Member shall cease receiving Pay Credits during any Plan Year as necessary to ensure (i) that the Active Member’s Pay Credits do not exceed the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit in effect for such Plan Year, and</p>
<p>(ii) that there is ongoing compliance with limitations set forth in Section 9.14. Specifications of an applicable percentage by the Vice President are made in the Vice President’s sole discretion, and at no time does an Eligible Employee have a legally binding right to be assigned any initial or increased applicable percentage.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p><u>Interest Credit</u>. To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Year, an individual must be either an Active Member or Inactive Member during such year, and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior Plan Year’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member’s Interest Credit shall be determined by the Vice President by multiplying the Interest Rate for the period since the last Valuation Date by the balance of the Member’s PIRP-DC Account as of such last Valuation Date.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>10</p>
<p>A Member’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the Vice President as soon as administratively practicable after each Valuation Date. If a Member has less than one full year of Active Membership since such last Valuation Date (<em>e.g.,</em> as may apply in the Member’s first and last year of Membership), the Member’s Pay Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a Member has less than one full year of Membership since such last Valuation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member’s fractional year of Membership (<em>e.g.</em>, as may apply in the Member’s last year of Membership). A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member’s days of Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Year by the total number of days in such Plan Year. A period of paid leave of absence during a Plan Year shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member’s Pay Credit for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence. However, a period of unpaid leave of absence during a Plan Year shall not be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member’s Pay Credit for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan Year containing the unpaid</p>
<p>leave shall be prorated, or there shall be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member’s period of Active Membership during the Plan Year). In the event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member’s final year of Membership, the Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date (with proration based upon the Member’s fractional final year of Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by the Vice President shall be conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants).</p>
<h2 id="offsets.">Offsets.</h2>

<li><p>Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Organization related to the Member’s termination of employment, to the extent the Vice President determines that the payment is reasonably related to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program.</p></li>

<p>Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would be provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V, or the Member’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether a benefit is material and all other aspects of the application of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the Vice President.</p>

A Member’s PIRP-DC Account is a bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer’s liability for such credits).

In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and effective under the DC Program, the Active Member’s request and the Vice President’s approval of the request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Subject to the next sentence, the effect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 5.03 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with this requirement.</p>

<p>If a Member’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date.

<h2 id="claims-procedure.">Claims Procedure.</h2>
<p>The Vice President, or a party designated by the Vice President, shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits with respect to a purported former or current Eligible Employee, Member, Dependant, or any other individual, person or entity asserting a right to a benefit under the Plan (a “Petitioner”). As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Vice President decides in</p>
<p>its discretion that the Petitioner is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the Vice President, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All decisions and determinations</p>
<p>made by the Vice President will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Vice President may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the</p>
<p>provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Vice President’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the breadth of the Vice President’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Vice President (or its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Vice President of its discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion).</p>
<p>If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Petitioner is wholly or partially denied, the Vice President, or a party designated by</p>
<p>the Vice President, will provide such Petitioner within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Vice President, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:</p>

<p>If the Vice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Vice President will notify the Petitioner before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President</p>
<p>expects to make the final decision. Upon review, the Vice President shall provide the Petitioner a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Vice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the Vice President’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the Petitioner before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the Petitioner; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the Petitioner is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim for benefits.</p>
<p>Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Vice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the Petitioner’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section. Exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the Petitioner took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the purported Petitioner was submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) the Petitioner is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested document from the Vice President at the time and in the form requested, (B) the Petitioner requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Vice President,</p>
<p>(C) the Vice President fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Petitioner took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the Petitioner was actually entitled to receive the requested documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Petitioner must provide sufficient information to place the Vice President on notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and (E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable claims of which the Petitioner has informed the Vice President.</p>

<h2 id="temporary-absence-of-member.">Temporary Absence of Member.</h2>
<p>If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, discharge, retirement or quitting (<em>e.g.</em>, sickness, accident, layoff, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is absent, unless the Vice President determines otherwise. If the Member’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full- time member of the armed forces of any country or of any organization engaged in national service of any such country, he shall</p>
<p>not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur.</p>
<h2 id="taxes-etc.">Taxes, Etc.</h2>
<p>In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the Vice President to be owing in respect of any benefit payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty.</p>
<h2 id="nonguarantee-of-employment.">Nonguarantee of Employment.</h2>
<p>Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its employees, with or without cause.</p>
<h2 id="no-right-to-benefits.">No Right to Benefits.</h2>
<p>No person, whether or not being a Member, shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member’s termination of employment by an Employer, the resulting cessation of his</p>
<p>Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any member of the PepsiCo Organization with respect to such termination.</p>
<h2 id="charges-on-benefits-and-recovery-of-excess-payments.">Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.</h2>
<p>All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand charged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the Vice President that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member. The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member’s benefits and be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Organization whose receipt shall be a valid discharge for the same.</p>
<p>Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable.</p>
<p>Accordingly, any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a person, trust fund or entity).</p></li>
<li><p>The right to offset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however, reliance on this right is in the discretion of the Vice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the Plan’s rights under paragraph (1) above.</p></li>
<li><p>The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may correspond to such party’s present or future residence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the Vice President that are in</p>
<p>furtherance of the Plan’s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way, including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.</p>
<h2 id="prohibited-misconduct.">Prohibited Misconduct.</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Vice President determines that a Member has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid previously, being paid currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such</p></li>
</ol>
<p>forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits</p>
<p>shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly, by a Member shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the Member’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Organization.</p></li>
<li><p>The Member, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member’s recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Organization employee to leave the PepsiCo Organization’s employment or to accept any position with any other entity.</p></li>
<li><p>The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Organization. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his positions with the PepsiCo Organization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo Organization’s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know- how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.</p></li>
<li><p>The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Organization’s best interests, including violating the Corporation’s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the PepsiCo Organization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation, participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who</p>
<p>files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document</p>
<p>containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.</p>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or</p>
<p>suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Organization is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks, tea, water, juice drinks, sports drinks, coffee drinks, energy drinks, and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies; hot cereals; pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals; dry pasta products; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo Organization during the Member’s employment with the PepsiCo Organization.</p>
<h2 id="notices.">Notices.</h2>
<p>Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be sufficiently given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the Vice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be sufficient if such notice is delivered to the Member’s last known</p>
<p>address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method (<em>e.g.</em>, electronically) that the Vice President determines is reasonably available to the Member.</p>
<h2 id="plan-documentation.">Plan Documentation.</h2>
<p>Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.</p>
<h2 id="currency-of-payment.">Currency of Payment.</h2>
<p>Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency," as approved by the Vice President. The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the</p>
<p>exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the Vice President from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="governing-law.">Governing Law.</h2>
<p>The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York and any</p>
<p>applicable federal law as would be applied in cases that arise in the United States District Courts that sit in the State of New York.</p>
<h2 id="exemption-from-erisa.">Exemption from ERISA.</h2>
<p>The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident</p>
<p>aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to</p>
<p>individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation</p>
<p>relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States.</p>
<h2 id="exemption-from-section-409a.">Exemption from Section 409A.</h2>
<p>In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section 409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, effective for any period to which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively, a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person. However, Interest Credits may be provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S. Person, but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on such Pay Credits). Accordingly, no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined, following the close of such year, that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the Vice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a</p>
<p>U.S. Person for such year. In other cases, the Member’s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement. This Section</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the Vice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement. Further, to ensure the continuation of such exemption from Section 409A, the preceding sentence shall be applied and given overriding effect notwithstanding any other provision or language in this Plan.</p></li>

<p>ARTICLE I.</p>
<p><u>Foreword</u></p>
<p>The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan. PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the</p>
<p>Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.</p>
<p><u>1989 Document</u>. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January 1, 1989.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Plan in effect prior to January 1, 1989 govern the rights and benefits of employees whose Credited Service ended before that date (and as necessary, before the effective date of any provision with a different pre-1989 effective date).</p>
<p><u>2005 Document</u>. This document (the “Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document”) was first effective as of January 1, 2005 (the “Effective Date”) and was restated to reflect amendments through December 31, 2008. It generally retained without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement. However, it was clarified to reflect that it set forth the terms of the Plan applicable to benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A, <em>i.e.</em>, generally, benefits that were both earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 (the “Pre-409A Program”).</p>
<p><u>2016 Restatement</u>. The 2016 restatement of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document was effective as of April 1, 2016. There were no material modifications made to the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as a result of the 2016 restatement. The Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document continues generally to retain without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement.</p>
<p>The 2016 restatement reflected amendments through April 1, 2016, including amendments to reflect the merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), effective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011. The PBG PEP document that was in effect on October 3, 2004 as amended through January 1, 2011 (“Pre-409A PBG PEP Document”) and as subsequently amended from time to time is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A; it continues to govern PBG PEP benefits that were grandfathered under Section</p>
<p>409A and that were subject to the Pre-409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger, except for certain administrative provisions now governed by the main portion of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP Program or the PBG PEP Program that would constitute a</p>
<p>material modification within the meaning of Treas. Reg.§ 1.409A-6(a)(4) as a result of the merger or the revisions to the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document and Pre-409A PBG PEP document.</p>
<p><u>2021 Restatement</u>. This restatement reflected amendments through January 1, 2021, including provisions that reflected updates to the Salaried Plan’s actuarial factors that became effective January 1, 2019.</p>
<p><u>2022 Restatement</u>: This restatement primarily updates the Plan’s claims, exhaustion, limitation and termination provisions.</p>
<p><u>409A Program</u>. All benefits under the Plan that are earned or vested after January 1, 1989 shall be governed by the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program (the “409A Program”). Together, this document (the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document) and the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program describe the terms of a single plan.</p>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p><u>Preservation of Pre-409A Program Within PEP Plan</u>. This document (the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document) has been modified to clarify (without any material modification) the integration of the Pre-409A Program with the 409A Program. However, amounts subject to the terms of this Pre-409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A as a program of grandfathered benefits.</p>

<p><u>Definitions and Construction</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Definitions</u>: This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases. Where the following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan with initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Accrued Benefit</u></strong>: The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with Article V, based on the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of determination.</p>

<p>the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1 below. Subsequently, the Plan Administrator may specify new factors for these and other forms of payment, in its sole and absolute discretion, by a resolution adopted by the Plan Administrator. A Participant’s benefit under the Pre-409A Program shall be determined under the actuarial factors specified and in effect as of the Annuity Starting Date of the Participant’s benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment specified by the Plan Administrator may be applied retroactively to previously accrued benefits, and without regard to the factors that previously applied for such purpose. In particular, in adjusting benefits under the Plan using the factors in Schedule 1 (below), the right to a benefit that is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall not apply (even when, for example, it would apply under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors). For this purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. If a Participant elects a survivor, period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(a) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period certain or other death benefit, and Schedule 1(b) or (c) shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection (for this purpose and</p>
<p>as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial</p>
<p>computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to similarly situated participants).</p>

Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><u>Claims Procedure</u>: The Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides</p></li>

<p>in its discretion that the Participant (or other applicant) is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the breadth of the Plan Administrator’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion).If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, will provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section. The Plan Administrator has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the steps described below. Within a 90-day response period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator will notice the claimant of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The specific reason or reasons for the denial;</p></li>
<li><p>Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;</p></li>
<li><p>A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and</p></li>
<li><p>A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process and a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on review).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances required an extension of time for processing the claim it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. Further review of a claim is available upon written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the claimant receives written notice of the</p>
<p>denial of the claim. Upon review, the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, documents, records and other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on</p>
<p>review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the</p>
<p>date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decisions. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based.</p>
<p>Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator, or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this Section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this Section</p>
<p>may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><u>Effect of Specific References</u>: Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator’s discretion shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court</u>. Before filing any Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken).</p></li>
<li><p>In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before the Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>(iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.3 that apply to claims for benefits).</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the purported Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the purported Claimant was submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for</p></li>
</ol>
<p>documents unless (A) the Claimant is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested document from the Plan Administrator at the time and in the form requested, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Plan Administrator, (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was actually entitled to receive the requested documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Claimant must provide sufficient information to place the Plan Administrator on notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and</p>
<p>(E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable claims of which the Claimant has informed the Plan Administrator.</p>

<p><u>Miscellaneous</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>No guarantee of Employment</u>: Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the employment of an Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or without cause.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Nonalienation of Benefits</u>: Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder, including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company. The Company shall not in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits hereunder.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Unfunded Plan</u>: The Company’s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’s general funds. To the extent the Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Action b</u>y <u>the Compan</u>y: Any action by the Company under this Plan, including any amendment authorized to be made under Section 9.2, may be made by the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, any person or persons authorized (directly or indirectly) by the Board may take such action on behalf of the Company.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Indemnification</u>: Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the Company shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Code Section 409A</u>: At all times, this Plan shall be operated to preserve the status of benefits under this Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, <em>i.e.</em>, to preserve the grandfathered status of this</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provision of the prior sentence shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan. Accordingly, in determining rights and benefits under this Pre-409A Program, changes in the Salaried Plan that are effective after December 31, 2004 shall be disregarded to the extent necessary to avoid a modification of this Pre-409A Program that would constitute a material modification for purposes of Section 409A.</p>

<li><p><u>Authorized Transfers</u>: If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization</p></li>

<p><u>Amendment and Termination</u></p>
<p>This Article governs the Company’s right to amend and or terminate the Plan. The Company’s amendment and termination powers under this Article shall be subject, in all cases, to the restrictions on amendment and termination in Section 409A and shall be exercised in accordance with such restrictions to ensure continued exemption from Section 409A in accordance with Section 8.6. The Company’s rights under this Article IX shall be as broad as permissible under applicable law.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Continuation of the Plan</u>: While the Company and the Employers intend to continue the Plan indefinitely, they assume no contractual obligation as to its continuance. In accordance with Section 8.4, the Company hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall adversely affect the amount of benefit to which a Participant or his beneficiary is entitled under Article IV on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the Participant becomes entitled to an amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the Company (except as necessary to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of this Pre-409A Program). Specific forms of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Amendments</u>: The Company may, in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive effect, including any amendment or amendments to eliminate available distribution options under Article VI hereof at any time before the earlier of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date under this Plan or under the Salaried Plan; provided, however, that no amendment of the Plan shall be effective to the extent that the amendment would be considered a “material modification” (as</p></li>

<p>that term is defined in Section 409A) of the Pre-409A Program and would, as a result, cause the Pre-409A Program to be subject to Section 409A. An Employer (other than the Company) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.</p>

<li><p><u>Termination</u>: The Company may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.

<p>Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation Top Hat Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Preservation Top Hat Plan.

<p><u>Accruals for 1993 and 1994</u></p>
<p>This Article A of the Appendix shall be effective on the date the Plan is adopted.</p>
<p>A.1 <u>Accruals for 1993 and 1994</u>: This section shall apply to any individual:</p>
<p>(i) who is a Salaried Plan Participant and employed by the PepsiCo Organization on</p>
<p>December 31, 1993, (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension is vested during 1993 (or would become vested in 1994 if his Service included the assumed period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below), and (iii) whose minimum 1993 Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article X. In determining the amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual, the provisions set forth in subsections (a) and (b) below shall apply.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Minimum 1993 Pension</u>: Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a minimum 1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993. In determining the amount of such individual’s minimum 1993 Pension, the following shall apply.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An individual’s Service and Credited Service as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if his Service continued through December 31, 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assumed period of continued Service shall be less to the extent the Corporation’s human resource records on December 31, 1993 reflect a scheduled termination date in 1994 for such individual. In this case, the individual’s assumed period of continued service shall be the portion of 1994 that ends with such scheduled termination date.</p></li>
<li><p>An individual’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be adjusted by the actuary’s salary scale assumption which is</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program</p>
<p>- 78 -</p>
<p>used under the Salaried Plan, so that they equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following special rules shall apply.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected 1994 earnings as reflected on the “Special PEP Salary Scale” of the PepsiCo Benefits Department on December 31, 1993 are higher than would be assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph. In this case, the individual’s 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using such higher salary scale.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(1) above is less than all of 1994, the salary adjustment under the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be reduced to the amount that would apply if the individual had no earnings after his scheduled termination date.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>An individual’s attained age as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to be the age he would have at the end of the assumed period of continued service applicable under paragraph (1) above.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any individual who is covered by this section, and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31, 1993, shall be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum 1993 Pension. For purposes of this subsection, Code section 401(a)(17) shall be applied in 1993 by giving effect to the amendments to such Code section made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1993.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p><u>Determination of 1994 Accrual</u>: If a participant in the Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993 Pension under subsection (a) above, the amount of any Pre-409A Pension for 1994 that accrues shall be only the amount by which the P Pension that would otherwise accrue for 1994 exceeds his minimum 1993 Pension under</p></li>

<p>Appendix.</p>
<p>ARTICLE I – Foreword</p>
<p>The PEP Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PBG for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.</p>
<p>This Plan is first effective April 6, 1999. The Plan is a successor plan to the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, which was last restated effective as of January 1, 1989. The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan covers eligible employees at the various divisions of PepsiCo, Inc., including eligible employees who are employed at various Pepsi- Cola Company facilities. On April 6, 1999, when this Plan became effective, PBG had its initial public offering. PBG employs many of the individuals employed at Pepsi-Cola Company facilities who were covered under the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan. This initial Plan document closely mirrors the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan document, including its historical provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under this Plan.</p>

<li><p><u>Certain Adjustments</u>: Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).</p>

<li><p><u>Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans</u>: If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder, the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.</p></li>

If a Participant’s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still an employee of the PBG Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)(9)), payment under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant’s Severance from Service Date. In this instance, the form of payment under this Plan shall remain that applicable under the Salaried Plan.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p><u>Advance Election in Effect</u>: This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who has an Advance Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, and (ii) whose Retirement Date is after 1993.

<p>PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program</p>
<p>- v -</p>
<p>ARTICLE I</p>
<p><u>Foreword</u></p>
<p>The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan. PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the</p>
<p>Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B thereof).</p>
<p><u>1989 Restatement</u>. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.</p>
<p><u>409A Program Document 2005 Restatement</u>. The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits that are subject to Section 409A, <em>i.e.</em>, generally, benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or materially modified within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).</p>
<p><u>Amendments to the 2005 Restatement</u>. The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), effective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011. The PBG PEP document that was in effect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger, except for certain administrative provisions that are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”)</p>
<p>under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP Document.</p>
<p><u>2017</u>, <u>2019</u>, <u>2021 and 2022 Restatements</u>. This restatement of the 409A Program Document is effective as of January 1, 2022. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated effective as of January 1, 2021, and prior to that, effective as of January 1, 2019, and prior to that, effective as of January 1, 2017.</p>
<p><u>Interpla</u>y <u>of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program</u>. All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to the 409A Program (i.e., generally, benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially modified thereafter within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together, this document and the document for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single plan. However, amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.</p>
<p><u>Freeze of the Salaried Plan</u>. In general, the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that would accrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the Salaried Plan. As a result, a Participant’s accrual of Plan benefits and a Participant’s growing into certain benefit enhancements (such as more favorable early commencement factors) are generally tied to the Participant’s accrual of benefits and growing into benefit enhancements under the Salaried Plan. For certain</p>
<p>Participants, there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the “PEP Guarantee”) or the Appendix that provide a benefit accrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of Code limitations to the Salaried Plan. Regardless, however, the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan effective as of that time. In addition, the Salaried Plan’s operational rules with respect to the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 govern the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 under this Plan.</p>

<p>ARTICLE II</p>
<p><u>Definitions and Construction</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Definitions</u>: This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below. Where the following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Accrued Benefit</u></strong>: The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with Article V, based on the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of determination.</p>
<p><strong><u>Actuarial Equivalent</u></strong>: Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the factors set forth below. The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner. In the event the Plan is amended to provide new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless specifically adopted by the amendment.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Annuities and Inflation Protection</u>: To determine the amount of a Pension payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity, as an annuity with inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity, the Plan Administrator shall select the factors that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the Appendix). Thereafter, the Plan Administrator shall review</p></li>
</ol>
<p>such factors for forms of payment (including for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall amend such factors in its discretion. In general, a Participant shall have no right to have any of the</p>
<p>actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit (or any portion thereof), except to the extent that a particular factor is currently in effect at the time it is to be applied under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment selected by the Plan Administrator from time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already accrued benefits, and without regard to the</p>
<p>actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such purpose. However, in adjusting benefits under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that become effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, the right to receive a benefit that is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same extent (and in the same manner) as applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors. For this purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor, period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(b) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period certain or other death benefit, and Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the</p>
<p>PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program</p>
<p>- 5 -</p>
<p>elected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to similarly situated participants).</p>

<p>*As this term is defined in the Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><u>Lump Sums</u>: To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, a Pre-Retirement</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Spouse’s Pension under Section 4.6, or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension under Section 4.12, the lump sum equivalent factors currently applicable to lump sum distributions under the Salaried Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance with paragraph (1) above.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><u>Other Cases</u>: To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Participant in other cases, the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan. In this respect,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be effective hereunder for Annuity Starting Dates (as defined under this Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to change in accordance with paragraph (1) above.</p>
<p><strong><u>Annuit</u>y</strong>: A Pension payable as a series of monthly payments for at least the life of the</p>
<p>Participant.</p>
<p><strong><u>Annuit</u>y <u>Starting Date</u></strong>: The Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the first period for which an amount is payable under this Plan as an annuity or in any other form. A Participant who: (1) is reemployed after his initial Annuity Starting Date, and (2) is entitled to benefits hereunder after his reemployment, shall have a subsequent Annuity Starting Date for such benefits only to the extent provided in Section 6.3(b).</p>
<p><strong><u>Cashout Limit</u></strong>: The annual dollar limit on elective deferrals under Code section 402(g)(1)(B), as in effect from time to time.</p>
<p><strong><u>Code</u></strong>: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. All references herein to particular Code Sections shall also refer to any successor provisions and shall include all related regulations, interpretations and other guidance.</p>

<p><strong><u>Covered Compensation</u></strong>: “Covered Compensation” as that term is defined in Part B of the Salaried Plan.</p>
<p><strong><u>Credited Service</u></strong>: The period of a Participant’s employment, calculated in accordance with Section 3.3, which is counted for purposes of determining the amount of benefits payable to, or on behalf of, the Participant.</p>
<p><strong><u>Disabilit</u>y <u>Retirement Pension</u></strong>: The Retirement Pension available to a Participant under</p>
<p>Section 4.5.</p>
<p><strong><u>Ear</u>ly <u>409A Retirement Pension</u></strong>: The 409A Retirement Pension available to a Participant under</p>
<p>Section 4.2.</p>
<p><strong><u>Elapsed Time Service</u></strong>: The period of time beginning with a Participant’s first date of employment with the PepsiCo Organization and ending with the Participant’s Final Separation from Service, irrespective of any breaks in service between those two dates. By way of illustration, if a Participant began employment with the PepsiCo Organization on January 1, 2000, left the employment of the PepsiCo Organization from January 1, 2001 until December 31, 2004, and was then reemployed by the PepsiCo Organization on January 1, 2005 until he had a Final Separation from Service on December 31, 2008, the Participant would have eight years of Elapsed Time Service as of his Final Separation from Service.</p>
<p><strong><u>El</u>ig<u>ible Domestic Partner.</u></strong> The definition in this Section 2.1 is effective for applicable dates on and after January 1, 2019, and applies solely to a Participant who is actively employed by, or on an Authorized Leave of Absence from, a member of the PepsiCo Organization on or after January 1, 2019.

<p><strong><u>Section 409A</u></strong>: Section 409A of the Code.</p>
<p><strong><u>Separation from Service</u></strong>: A Participant’s separation from service with the PepsiCo Organization, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb (<em>i.e.</em>, “Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’s transfer to an entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the extent permitted by Section 409A. A Participant’s “Final Separation from Service” is the date of his Separation from Service that most recently precedes his Annuity Starting Date; provided, however, that to the extent a Participant is reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with respect to any benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles shall generally apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires, or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company. Whether a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such leave does not exceed a period of six months or, if longer, such longer period of time during which a right to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month period.</p></li>
<li><p>If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, the services</p></li>
</ol>
<p>provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.</p>

<p><strong><u>Single Life Annuit</u>y</strong>: A level monthly Annuity payable to a Participant for his life only, with no survivor benefits to his Eligible Spouse or any other person.</p>
<p><strong><u>Single Lum</u>p Sum</strong>: The distribution of a Participant’s total 409A Pension in the form of a single payment, which payment shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s 409A Pension as of the</p>
<p>Participant’s Normal Retirement Date (or Late Retirement Date, if applicable), but not less than the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s 409A Pension as of the Participant’s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.</p>
<p><strong><u>Social Securit</u>y <u>Act</u></strong>: The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability. Any reference herein to the Social Security Act (or any of the benefits provided thereunder) shall be taken as a reference to any comparable governmental program of another country, as determined by the Plan Administrator, but only to the extent the Plan Administrator judges the computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.</p>
<p><strong><u>Taxable Wage Base</u></strong>: The contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) in effect for the Plan Year.</p>
<p><strong><u>Vested Pension</u></strong>: The Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.3. The term “409A Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Vested Pension that is derived from the 409A Program. The term “Pre-409A Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Vested Pension that is derived from the Pre-409A Program.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Construction</u>: The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Gender and Number</u>: Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, (i) a reference to one or more genders shall include a reference to all the other genders, and (ii) the singular may include the plural, and the plural may include the singular.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Compounds of the Word “Here”</u>: The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or section.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Examples</u>: Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passages of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limits on its breadth of application).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Subdivisions of the Plan Document</u>: This Plan document is divided and subdivided using the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and sub- clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal</p></li>

<p>point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals in parentheses.</p>
<p>Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Sub-clauses are designated by upper-case roman numerals in parentheses. Any reference in a section to a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.</p>

Therefore, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, when pursuant to Section 4.5 a Participant is entitled to Post-Disability Accruals after having become entitled to Pre-Separation Accruals, such an offset of the Pre-Separation Accruals will apply in determining the Post- Disability Accruals.</p>

The Participant shall give such notification to the Plan Administrator when he makes the election described in subsection (a) above or in accordance with such other procedures that are established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (if any).

<p>ARTICLE VII</p>
<p><u>Administration</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Authori</u>ty <u>to Administer Plan</u>: The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, which shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in writing, including the Participant’s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator’s interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to the Company or the Plan Administrator.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Facili</u>ty <u>of Payment</u>: Whenever, in the Plan Administrator’s opinion, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the</p></li>
</ol>
<p>legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><u>Claims Procedure</u>: The Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret</p></li>
</ol>
<p>PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program</p>
<p>- 73 -</p>
<p>the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the Participant (or other applicant) is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the breadth of the Plan Administrator’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The specific reason or reasons for such denial;</p></li>
<li><p>Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;</p></li>
<li><p>A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and</p></li>
<li><p>A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process and a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on review).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator, or the designated party, within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review, the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless</p>
<p>circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances</p>
<p>requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request ad free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.</p>
<p>Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><u>Effect of Specific References</u>: Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator’s discretion shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:</u> Before filing any Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken).</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.3 that apply to claims for benefits).</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the purported Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the purported Claimant was</p></li>
</ol>
<p>submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) the Claimant is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested document from the Plan Administrator at the time and in the form requested, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Plan Administrator, (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was actually entitled to receive the requested documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Claimant must provide sufficient information to place the Plan Administrator on notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and (E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable claims of which the Claimant has informed the Plan Administrator.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Nonguarantee of Employment</u>: Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the employment of an Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or without cause.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Nonalienation of Benefits</u>: Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits payable hereunder, including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company. The Company shall not in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits hereunder.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Unfunded Plan</u>: The Company’s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’s general funds. To the extent the Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Action b</u>y <u>the Compan</u>y: Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Board of Directors, with a report of any actions taken by it to the Board of Directors. In addition, such action may be made by any other person or persons duly authorized by resolution of said Board to take such action.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><u>Indemnification</u>: Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the Company shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Compliance with Section 409A</u>:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>General</u>: It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further, in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company, the Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or determinations made in good faith.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Non-duplication of benefits</u>: In the interest of clarity, and to determine benefits in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest Average Monthly Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any similar provision, no duplication of benefits may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a specific provision of the Plan provides for recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable earnings or service) and this same</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<li><p><u>Operating Rules for 2006 and 2007</u>. To ensure that the Company did not fail to identify any Key Employees, in the case of Separation from Service distributions during the 2006 Plan Year and 2007 Plan Year, the Company treated as Key Employees for such applicable Plan Year of their Separation from Service those individuals who met the provisions of (3) or (4) below (or both).</p></li>

Any action that may be taken (and, to the extent possible, any action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator or the Company shall not be taken (or shall be void and without effect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if such action would adversely affect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. If the failure to take an action under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the extent it is possible thereby to avoid a violation of Section 409A, the rights and effects under the Plan shall be altered to avoid such violation. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a failure to take an action that would adversely affect the grandfather of the Pre- 409A Program. Any provision in this Plan</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Credited Service and Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be taken into account more than once, and a PIRP Transfer Participant’s Total Pension shall be determined in a way that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP Transfer Participant under PIRP- DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or an affiliate, but without applying any offset that would violate Code Section 409A.</p>

<p>under PIRP-DB, then the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP Transfer Participant’s retirement under PIRP-DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP, shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’s discretion, in the Participant’s benefit under this Plan that is payable at the time and in the form applicable under this Plan.

<li><p>Scope:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F.2 below. The benefit of a Covered</p>
<p>U.K. Employee shall be determined as provided in Section F.3 below. Once a benefit is determined for a Covered</p>
<p>U.K. Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’s normal terms regarding the time and form of payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has been restated effective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was effective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in accordance with its prior terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><u>“Covered U.K. Employee” Defined</u>:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i) becomes subject to United States income taxes, <em>e.g.</em>, by transferring to a position with the Company in the United States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv) subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B) terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined in the Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by</p>
<p>the Company (in its completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S. Commencement Date”), and it shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or, if earlier, the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><u>Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees</u>:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A Covered U.K. Employee’s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S. Cessation Date, his “Total U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’s—</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>“Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F.2, (iii) the date he commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code), or (iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.</p></li>
<li><p>“Total U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms of the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under U.K. law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this Article F commence, and</p></li>
<li><p>“Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the</p></li>
</ol>
<p>U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this Article F commence.</p>
<p>The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth in Section F.4 below.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><u>Operating Rules:</u></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F.3. above.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee’s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section</p></li>
</ol>
<p>F.3. Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F.3 to the contrary, to the extent a Covered</p>
<p>U.K. Employee’s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.</p>
<p>Employee’s U.S. Cessation Date have more than fully offset the Covered U.K. Employee’s accruals under the</p>
<p>U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been offset against the benefit under this Article F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the date benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be offset against the benefits under this Article F to the extent such offset would not violate Code Section 409A.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F, the actuarial assumptions that are used shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section</p></li>
</ol>
<p>417(e) of the Code and, specifically, are the Code Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the Salaried Plan to pay a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be determined under this Article F.</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>A Covered U.K. Employee’s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis of assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service relationship with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.</p></li>
<li><p>This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F.3 calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year. In this case, to the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F.3 shall be made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively effective starting with the immediately following year.</p></li>
<li><p>In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F, (ii) has reached his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).</p></li>
<li><p>In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F, (ii) has reached his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would be eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then the Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><u>No Other Benefits</u>:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F.2. were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right to a benefit under this Article F. Accordingly, for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F (<em>e.g.</em>, by deciding that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’s discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time, and regardless of any other factor.</p>

<p>To ensure there will be no “material modification” of the Pre-409A Program, this Article provides a makeup benefit under the 409A Program that applies to certain participants in the Pre-409A Program (“Pre- 409A Participants”) in lieu of updating the Pre-409A Program’s actuarial factors for early commencement of Vested Pensions to be consistent with the “2019 Salaried Program Factors” (as that term is defined in the definition of Actuarial Equivalent). In the case of participants in the Pre-409A Program who are also Participants in the 409A Program (without regard to this Article), this makeup relating to the early commencement reduction of Vested Pensions payable as annuities is provided under the main text of the Plan. However, this makeup is provided under this Article in the case of affected Pre-409A Participants who are otherwise not entitled to a benefit under the 409A Program.</p>

<li><p>Who otherwise would not have a 409A Pension that is payable effective as of January 1, 2019 or later because, except as provided in this Article, the only PEP Pension to which the individual is entitled is a Pre-409A Pension, or because his otherwise applicable 409A Pension commenced payment as of prior to January 1, 2019.</p></li>

<p>In the event that the Eligible Person’s applicable commencement date is the date in subsection (a) above, then the date of actual payment of the benefit shall be delayed to the extent provided by Section 6.6(a) of the main text of the Plan, and in the case of such a delay, the benefit determined as of such applicable commencement date shall be increased by interest for the period of delay as provided in Section 6.6(c) of the main text of the Plan.</p>

<p>The foregoing Sections of this Article are intended to provide a make-up benefit under the 409A Program for applying an early commencement reduction under the Pre-409A Program using factors that predate the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors, with respect to a Pre-409A Pension that is paid in the form of an annuity and that has an Annuity Starting Date of January 1, 2019 or later. However, no duplication of benefits may occur at any time under the Plan.</p>
<p>Therefore, to the extent an Eligible Person has received or will receive a 409A Pension that, without regard to this Article, effectively provides some or all of such makeup (<em>e.g.</em>, because the Eligible Person’s 409A Pension was reduced for early commencement using Early Retirement reduction factors), or to the extent that the Plan Administrator concludes that providing the makeup under this Article would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits, the makeup benefit under this Article shall be reduced (but not below zero) as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate to eliminate all</p>
<p>duplication of benefits. This provision shall govern over any contrary provision of this Article or the Plan that might be interpreted to support a duplication of benefits.</p>

<p>Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2011, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo PEP, with the PepsiCo PEP as the surviving plan after the merger. The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the merger, except as follows: (i) Articles VII (Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and Termination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI (Applicable Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document, and (ii) effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor, period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity (or an annuity with other optional features), the adjustment of the Single Life Annuity to Actuarial Equivalent optional annuity shall be determined under the provisions of the main section of this document. There shall be no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Code section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Document as a result of the plan merger or the revisions made to the 409A PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="article-i-to-appendix-article-pbg---history-and-purpose">ARTICLE I TO APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - HISTORY AND PURPOSE</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>History of Plan</strong></em>. The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) effective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’s April 6, 1999 initial public offering, and the Plan included</p></li>
</ol>
<p>historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the</p>
<p>Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009, the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the</p>
<p>employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program and for certain executives who would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP (or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Effective Time). The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of management or highly- compensated employees.</p>
<p>The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG with and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company and Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Company, Inc., and to facilitate the Company’s assumption of PBG’s role as the Plan’s sponsor.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Effect of Amendment and Restatement</strong></em>. The Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the Prior Plan.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’s benefit (including death benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004 as if the Participant had terminated employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid or services rendered after 2004, or any other events affecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than the Participant’s survival or the</p>
<p>Participant’s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of benefit) (the “Grandfathered Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004. The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by the Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan effective January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not commenced receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith interpretation of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as payable under a separate Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

However, if there are at least 200 Specified Employees without regard to this provision, then it shall not apply.

Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8) and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, which permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction separate lists of specified employees where it is determined that such treatment would be administratively less burdensome.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><u>Identification of Specified Employees on and After April 1</u>, <u>2010</u>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the periods on after April 1, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:</p>

If the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying Specified Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together, would result in more than 200 individuals being counted as Specified Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Specified Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the highest.</p></li>
<li><p>For purposes of this paragraph (5), “PAS Business” means each employer, division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PAS business; “PBG Business” means each employer, division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo Business” means each employer, division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PepsiCo business.</p></li>

Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below.</p>

<li><p>If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced by 3/12<sup>ths</sup> of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement Date.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried Plan for any Pre-Retirement Spouse’s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s coverage shall apply.</p></li>
<li><p>This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, that is greater than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.</p></li>
<li><p>This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner. In this instance, the Participant’s PEP Guarantee under this section</p></li>

<p>shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’s life.</p>
<ol start="5" type="A">
<li><p>This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan.

<ol start="3" type="i">
<li><p><u>Lump Sum Conversion</u>. The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.</p></li>

<li><p><em><strong>Certain Adjustments</strong></em>. Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a member of the PBG</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).</p>

<li><p><strong><u>Adjustments for Rehired Partic</u>i<u>pants</u></strong>. This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant was not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP. In such event, the Participant’s PEP Pension shall be recalculated hereunder. For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in- service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><u>Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans</u></strong>. If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder, the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><u>No Benefit Offsets That Would Violate Section 409A</u></strong>. If a Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG</p></li>

<p>Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the “Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such Transfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)</p>
<p>(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on offsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan, and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into effect in a particular situation, the limit on offsets in the prior sentence will not apply.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Reemployment of Certain Participants</strong></em>. In the case of a current or former Participant who is reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non- Grandfathered PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service after such reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the present value of PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Vesting; Misconduct</strong></em>. Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or any other provision of the Plan to the</p></li>
</ol>
<p>contrary, a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan Administrator determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below, determined without regard to whether the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’s Severance from Service. The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the Participant within the twelve month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in such Misconduct, as determined by the Plan Administrator.</p>
<p>“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensors or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or Employer, including but not limited to violation of the Company’s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any information about the Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company or Employer unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv) improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that</p>
<p>Participant’s employment or other relationship with the Company; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Company or Employer, including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony or other serious crime or engaging in any activity</p>
<p>which constitutes gross misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations. The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.</p>
